<p>First, let’s review some facts about Evergreen.</p>
<p>Evergreen Line <a href=""https://www.evergreen-line.com/static/jsp/whats.jsp"">is the trade name</a> for the five shipping companies owned by the Evergreen Group. The companies comprise the fourth largest container fleet in the world, <a href=""https://www.joc.com/maritime-news/container-lines/evergreen-line"">according to</a> the JOC Group, a logistics intelligence firm.</p>
<p>An Evergreen ship <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-suez-canal-is-blocked-by-a-giant-container-ship-11616560437?mod=article_inline"">got stuck</a> in a bank of the Suez Canal during a dust storm with high winds, the Wall Street Journal reported. The incident involves an Ever Given ship, which is one of the largest ocean vessels in the world. More than 100 ships are waiting to traverse the canal, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/cargo-ship-stuck-suez-canal-egypt-d8b6696716ab45794cba583ecf0e4001"">dealing a blow</a> to global shipping.</p>
<p>The story turns into fiction with the added elements of Clinton and human trafficking. The conspiracy theory goes like this: Clinton is part of a global child sex trafficking cabal, and her Secret Service codename was ""<a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/while-campaigning-in-montana-clinton-reveals-secret-service-codename/"">Evergreen</a>."" (She confirmed the <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/while-campaigning-in-montana-clinton-reveals-secret-service-codename/"">codename</a> during the 2016 campaign.) Therefore, Clinton is using Evergreen to transport children.</p>
<p>That baseless line is related to the broader <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2016/dec/05/how-pizzagate-went-fake-news-real-problem-dc-busin/"">Pizzagate</a> and <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/aug/27/what-qanon-baseless-conspiracy-spilling-us-politic/"">QAnon</a> conspiracy theories about prominent Democrats and child victims.</p>
<p>After the Ever Given ship got stuck in the Suez Canal, QAnon supporters on Telegram and Gab, social media platforms that are popular among conservatives, pointed to <a href=""https://www.vesseltracker.com/cn/Ships/Ever-Given-9811000.html?show=details"">the boat’s call sign</a>, H3RC, as evidence to support their theory. Clinton’s initials are HRC.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what cargo the Evergreen ship is carrying, but there’s no evidence that it’s people. We reached out to Evergreen through its website for a comment, but we haven’t heard back.</p>
<p>The post is inaccurate, ridiculous and free of proof. We rate it Pants on Fire!</p></body></html>

First, let’s review some facts about Evergreen.
Evergreen Line is the trade name for the five shipping companies owned by the Evergreen Group. The companies comprise the fourth largest container fleet in the world, according to the JOC Group, a logistics intelligence firm.
An Evergreen ship got stuck in a bank of the Suez Canal during a dust storm with high winds, the Wall Street Journal reported.

<html><body><p>After a teenage gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., Americans of all political persuasions flocked to social media to express their views on gun policy.</p>
<p>On the pro-gun control side of the argument, <a href=""https://twitter.com/ArevaMartin"">Areva Martin</a>, an author and TV commentator, <a href=""https://twitter.com/ArevaMartin/status/965236419433082880"">tweeted a graphic</a> that showed in most of the country, it is harder to vote than it is to buy an assault rifle.</p>
<p>She shared the following graphic with the comment, ""Just let this sink in! #FloridaSchoolShooting #Florida #GunReformNow.""</p>
<div class=""artembed""><a id=""see-figure-1-on-politifactcom""></a><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" data-lang=""en""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Just let this sink in! <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/FloridaSchoolShooting?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#FloridaSchoolShooting</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Florida?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Florida</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/GunReformNow?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#GunReformNow</a> <a href=""https://t.co/h5EvrgDwsY"">pic.twitter.com/h5EvrgDwsY</a></p>— Areva Martin, Esq.

<script async="""" charset=""utf-8"" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script>
</div>
<p>However, a closer look at both gun policy and election law suggest some important caveats that the graphic leaves out. (Martin did not reply to an inquiry from her representative.)</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Where the graphic came from</div>
<p>Unlike many viral images we see, this one provided its sourcing.</p>
<p>It cited an article by Alex Seitz-Wald in <a href=""https://www.salon.com/2013/08/29/clintons_line_was_true_the_sad_facts_about_assault_weapons_and_voting/"">Salon.com</a> and the liberal Center for American Progress. The chart was put together from elements of the Salon article by Adam Peck, an editor with the website ThinkProgress, which is affiliated with the Center for American Progress. Peck told PolitiFact that the graphic was originally created to be embedded in a separate <a href=""https://thinkprogress.org/why-its-easier-to-buy-an-assault-weapon-than-to-vote-in-one-graphic-f9a96846f90a/"">Think Progress article</a>.</p>
<p>The accompanying ThinkProgress article ""was our opportunity to provide readers with the kind of information and nuance that simply don't work in a visual capacity,"" Peck said. ""Obviously, the pitfall is that those graphics can be easily divorced from their companion articles, losing whatever nuance we set out to provide.""</p>
<p>Also important to note: The Salon article, the ThinkProgress article and the graphic were all published in 2013. (Seitz-Wald has been at NBC News since 2014.)</p>
<p>So the underlying data is five years old.</p>
<p>The meme’s re-emergence means there’s been a game of telephone, with notable context falling by the wayside.</p>

<div class=""pf_subheadline"">IDs to buy guns</div>
<p>You wouldn’t know it from the graphic, but whether an ID is required for a gun sale depends on who is making the sale.</p>
<p>Under <a href=""https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/nics-background-check-required-transfer-long-guns-well-handguns"">federal law</a>, federally licensed gun dealers, importers and manufacturers must run background checks for sales to an unlicensed buyer. Specifically, a potential purchaser must show identification, complete a federal document known as a <a href=""https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics-firearms-licensee-manual-111811.pdf"">Form 4473</a>, and pass a National Instant Criminal Background Check System check.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>Where the meme has a point is that in the states that didn’t pass a tougher law, unlicensed private sellers are <a href=""http://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/explainer/article/gun-laws-regulations-firearms-8381025.php"">exempted</a> from having to complete the background check process. Commonly, such unlicensed sellers operate from gun shows or flea markets, although a licensed dealer selling from a show would have to run the background check.</p>
<p>""For anyone who thinks he or she might not pass a background check, or is looking to circumvent any waiting period, they can bypass both in a majority of states,"" said Peck, the graphic's creator.</p>
<p>As Seitz-Wald noted in his article, states can add their own restrictions on top of these requirements. At the time the article was written, only about a third had done so. Since then, Oregon and Washington have begun requiring background checks (and thus an ID) on all gun sales, including private transfers.</p>
<p>This distinction — between the rules for licensed sellers and for unlicensed sellers — didn’t make it into the meme.</p>
<p>That matters. While it is possible in many states to buy a firearm without an ID by seeking out an unlicensed seller, such purchases account for a fraction of all sales. Gun shops and other types of brick-and-mortar stores — where background checks are required — account for a majority of purchases.</p>
<p>A <a href=""http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2595892"">research paper</a> published last year in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> found that of the 70 percent of gun transfers studied that were purchases — as opposed to gifts and inheritances — <a href=""http://annals.org/data/Journals/AIM/936061/M161590tt3_Table_3_Summary_of_Most_Recent_Firearm_Transfer_by_Type_of_Acquisition.jpeg"">53 percent</a> were purchased from stores and 17 percent were purchased from family, friends, online or gun shows. Those percentages have increased over time. In the past two years, 64 percent were purchased at stores.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s certainly possible to purchase a gun without an ID in many states, but in reality, a large majority of purchases are done with IDs and background checks.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">States requiring IDs for voting</div>
<p>The graphic is more problematic on the point that in no state can you vote without proof of ID.</p>
<p>It’s certainly true that a number of states have requirements for voters to hand over a government-issued photo ID in one of just a few categories, such as driver’s licenses. The strictest of these include Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin, according to the <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx#Variation"">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>.</p>
<p>Other states also have ID requirements to vote, but in many cases, they allow easier-to-obtain paperwork, including documents without a photograph in some cases. Some of the valid documents, depending on the state, include student ID cards, utility bills, bank statements, paychecks, government checks, Medicare or Medicaid cards, employer ID cards, or a bank or debit card.</p>
<p>Finally, there are <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-verification-without-id-documents.aspx"">16 states</a> that do not currently require documents at polling booths at all. They are California, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wyoming.</p>
<p>So the notion that every state requires an ID to vote is incorrect.</p>
<p>If the graphic had said that an ID is required to register to vote, it would have been somewhat more accurate. Under the federal <a href=""http://files.findlaw.com/pdf/civilrights/civilrights.findlaw.com_other-constitutional-rights_federal-voter-id-requirements-the-help-america-vote-act-hava.pdf"">Help America Vote Act</a>, every state must request identification when registering first-time voters who did not register in person and did not provide identification when filling out the mail-in registration form. For these voters, a wide variety of documents are accepted for registration; many states allow some of the non-photo IDs cited above to serve that purpose.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>The viral image said that in most states, you can buy an assault rifle with no proof of ID, but in every state, you need proof of ID to vote.</p>
<p>It is indeed possible to buy an assault rifle without an ID if you go to a gun show — but the graphic neglects to mention that these sales are the exception rather than the rule. A significant majority of gun purchases are made in transactions that require ID and a background check.</p>
<p>As for the voting claim, some states have imposed strict photo ID laws at the voting booth. However, the graphic ignores that about one-third of states require no ID at all to vote, and that many of those that do require identification allow a range of documents to serve that purpose, including student IDs, utility bills and debit cards.</p>
<p>We rate the viral image Mostly False.</p>

</div>]","After a teenage gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., Americans of all political persuasions flocked to social media to express their views on gun policy.
On the pro-gun control side of the argument, Areva Martin, an author and TV commentator, tweeted a graphic that showed in most of the country, it is harder to vote than it is to buy an assault rifle.
She shared the following graphic with the comment, ""Just let this sink in! #FloridaSchoolShooting #Florida #GunReformNow.""
Just let this sink in! #FloridaSchoolShooting #Florida #GunReformNow pic.twitter.com/h5EvrgDwsY— Areva Martin, Esq. (@ArevaMartin) February 18, 2018


However, a closer look at both gun policy and election law suggest some important caveats that the graphic leaves out. (Martin did not reply to an inquiry from her representative.)
Where the graphic came from
Unlike many viral images we see, this one provided its sourcing.
It cited an article by Alex Seitz-Wald in Salon.com and the liberal Center for American Progress. The chart was put together from elements of the Salon article by Adam Peck, an editor with the website ThinkProgress, which is affiliated with the Center for American Progress. Peck told PolitiFact that the graphic was originally created to be embedded in a separate Think Progress article.
The accompanying ThinkProgress article ""was our opportunity to provide readers with the kind of information and nuance that simply don't work in a visual capacity,"" Peck said. ""Obviously, the pitfall is that those graphics can be easily divorced from their companion articles, losing whatever nuance we set out to provide.""
Also important to note: The Salon article, the ThinkProgress article and the graphic were all published in 2013. (Seitz-Wald has been at NBC News since 2014.)
So the underlying data is five years old.
The meme’s re-emergence means there’s been a game of telephone, with notable context falling by the wayside.

IDs to buy guns
You wouldn’t know it from the graphic, but whether an ID is required for a gun sale depends on who is making the sale.
Under federal law, federally licensed gun dealers, importers and manufacturers must run background checks for sales to an unlicensed buyer. Specifically, a potential purchaser must show identification, complete a federal document known as a Form 4473, and pass a National Instant Criminal Background Check System check.

Featured Fact-check
















Donald Trump


stated on April 30, 2023 in a Truth Social post








A Florida elections bill “guts everything” “instead of getting tough, and doing what the people want (same day voting, Voter ID, proof of Citizenship, paper ballots, hand count, etc.).”












By Amy Sherman • May 3, 2023







Where the meme has a point is that in the states that didn’t pass a tougher law, unlicensed private sellers are exempted from having to complete the background check process. Commonly, such unlicensed sellers operate from gun shows or flea markets, although a licensed dealer selling from a show would have to run the background check.
""For anyone who thinks he or she might not pass a background check, or is looking to circumvent any waiting period, they can bypass both in a majority of states,"" said Peck, the graphic's creator.
As Seitz-Wald noted in his article, states can add their own restrictions on top of these requirements. At the time the article was written, only about a third had done so. Since then, Oregon and Washington have begun requiring background checks (and thus an ID) on all gun sales, including private transfers.
This distinction — between the rules for licensed sellers and for unlicensed sellers — didn’t make it into the meme.
That matters. While it is possible in many states to buy a firearm without an ID by seeking out an unlicensed seller, such purchases account for a fraction of all sales. Gun shops and other types of brick-and-mortar stores — where background checks are required — account for a majority of purchases.
A research paper published last year in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that of the 70 percent of gun transfers studied that were purchases — as opposed to gifts and inheritances — 53 percent were purchased from stores and 17 percent were purchased from family, friends, online or gun shows. Those percentages have increased over time. In the past two years, 64 percent were purchased at stores.
In other words, it’s certainly possible to purchase a gun without an ID in many states, but in reality, a large majority of purchases are done with IDs and background checks.
States requiring IDs for voting
The graphic is more problematic on the point that in no state can you vote without proof of ID.
It’s certainly true that a number of states have requirements for voters to hand over a government-issued photo ID in one of just a few categories, such as driver’s licenses. The strictest of these include Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Other states also have ID requirements to vote, but in many cases, they allow easier-to-obtain paperwork, including documents without a photograph in some cases. Some of the valid documents, depending on the state, include student ID cards, utility bills, bank statements, paychecks, government checks, Medicare or Medicaid cards, employer ID cards, or a bank or debit card.
Finally, there are 16 states that do not currently require documents at polling booths at all. They are California, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wyoming.
So the notion that every state requires an ID to vote is incorrect.
If the graphic had said that an ID is required to register to vote, it would have been somewhat more accurate. Under the federal Help America Vote Act, every state must request identification when registering first-time voters who did not register in person and did not provide identification when filling out the mail-in registration form. For these voters, a wide variety of documents are accepted for registration; many states allow some of the non-photo IDs cited above to serve that purpose.

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani says Hillary Clinton is only pretending to be a feminist.</p>
<p>On NBC’s <em><a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/rudy-giuliani-full-interview-trump-tax-story-proves-nothing-777542211547"">Meet the Press</a></em> Oct. 2, <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/27/politics/rudy-giuliani-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-monica-lewinsky/"">Giuliani</a> criticized the Democratic presidential nominee for ""attacking"" women who have accused her husband, former President Bill Clinton, of sexual abuse. He also brought up Hillary Clinton’s record on human rights.</p>
<p>""A woman who pretends to be a feminist shouldn't be taking money from countries where women are stoned, where women are killed for adultery, and women can't drive,"" Giuliani said. ""She's taken hundreds of millions from those countries.""</p>
<p>Giuliani was referring to the Clinton Foundation, which has brought in <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clintons-raised-nearly-2-billion-for-foundation-since-2001/2015/02/18/b8425d88-a7cd-11e4-a7c2-03d37af98440_story.html"">significant amounts of money</a> from foreign entities and governments to fund its international charitable programs.</p>
<p>One of the biggest <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/sep/23/politifact-sheet-comparing-clinton-and-trump-found/"">concerns</a> about the Clinton Foundation is that some of this foreign money came from countries with <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/arizona/statements/2016/jul/11/donald-trump/did-hillary-clinton-take-money-countries-treat-wom/"">questionable records</a> on human rights, as well as countries that had business before the State Department while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.</p>
<p>On this particular claim, though, Giuliani stretches the truth. The donations from the countries in question do not come close to ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars. And the money goes to the foundation, not to Clinton.</p>
<p>Giuliani specifically mentioned countries where women are <a href=""http://news.trust.org//item/20130927165059-w9g0i"">stoned</a>, killed for adultery and <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/07/dean-obeidallah/obeidallah-saudi-arabia-only-muslim-nation-where-w/"">can’t drive</a>. By our count — using the State Department’s <a href=""http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/#wrappe"">Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> and Cornell University’s <a href=""https://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/"">death penalty database</a> — we found four countries who fall loosely into these categories: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.</p>
<p>Here’s a chart laying out those countries’ stance on adultery, stoning and women driving, and donations to the Clinton Foundation. (The foundation lists donors on <a href=""https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%24500%2C001%20to%20%241%2C000%2C000&amp;page=2"">its website</a>, organized into groups based on the size of the donation, without giving the specific dollar amount.)</p>

<p>In total, the Clinton Foundation brought in between $16.05 million and $40.1 million. That’s not a small number, but it’s nowhere near ""hundreds of millions."" Saudi Arabia is the clearest example of what Giuliani is talking about, and it donated a maximum of $25 million.</p>
<p>We should note that outside the narrow band of countries that ban women from driving and stone them for adultery, a few other countries with other women’s rights issues donated to the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>For example, Qatar, which donated between $1 million and $5 million, allows for flogging (non-lethal) as a punishment for adultery. And Brunei, which donated between $1 million and $5 million, specifically says spousal intercourse cannot be considered rape.</p>
<p>But even if you expand the group of foundation donors to countries that have significant women’s rights issues generally, <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/arizona/statements/2016/jul/11/donald-trump/did-hillary-clinton-take-money-countries-treat-wom/"">the donations do not amount to</a> ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note Giuliani’s phrasing. He said, ""She's taken hundreds of millions from those countries,"" referring to Hillary Clinton herself.</p>
<p>But the donations did not go to Clinton personally; they went to the foundation. While Clinton has been intimately involved in the foundation when not serving in the government or running for office, neither Clinton nor her political campaigns have ever received a <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/sep/01/hilary-rosen/democrat-pundit-clintons-get-no-personal-benefit-f/"">direct monetary benefit</a>, such as a salary, from the foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>Giuliani said Hillary Clinton has ""taken hundreds of millions from those countries"" where ""women are stoned, where women are killed for adultery and women can't drive.""</p>
<p>The Clinton Foundation, not Clinton personally, has taken in tens of millions of dollars, not hundreds of millions, from countries that have questionable records on women’s rights, including those that ban driving and stone women for adultery.</p>
<p>Giuliani’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.</p>

</div>]","Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani says Hillary Clinton is only pretending to be a feminist.
On NBC’s Meet the Press Oct. 2, Giuliani criticized the Democratic presidential nominee for ""attacking"" women who have accused her husband, former President Bill Clinton, of sexual abuse. He also brought up Hillary Clinton’s record on human rights.
""A woman who pretends to be a feminist shouldn't be taking money from countries where women are stoned, where women are killed for adultery, and women can't drive,"" Giuliani said. ""She's taken hundreds of millions from those countries.""
Giuliani was referring to the Clinton Foundation, which has brought in significant amounts of money from foreign entities and governments to fund its international charitable programs.
One of the biggest concerns about the Clinton Foundation is that some of this foreign money came from countries with questionable records on human rights, as well as countries that had business before the State Department while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.
On this particular claim, though, Giuliani stretches the truth. The donations from the countries in question do not come close to ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars. And the money goes to the foundation, not to Clinton.
Giuliani specifically mentioned countries where women are stoned, killed for adultery and can’t drive. By our count — using the State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and Cornell University’s death penalty database — we found four countries who fall loosely into these categories: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
Here’s a chart laying out those countries’ stance on adultery, stoning and women driving, and donations to the Clinton Foundation. (The foundation lists donors on its website, organized into groups based on the size of the donation, without giving the specific dollar amount.)




Country


Donation to Clinton Foundation


Women’s rights issues




Saudi Arabia


$10 million - $25 million


Women are not allowed to drive. Adultery is illegal, and perpetrators can be sentenced to death by stoning.




Kuwait


$5 million - $10 million

Featured Fact-check
















Jonathan Martin


stated on April 30, 2023 in a roundtable on ABC's ""This Week""








“Joe Biden was older on his first day as president than Ronald Reagan was on his last day.”












By Louis Jacobson • May 1, 2023









Lenient sentence for a person who kills someone caught in the act of adultery.




United Arab Emirates


$1 million - $5 million


Sharia courts allow flogging as a punishment for adultery, and stoning is a form of execution.




Bahrain


$50,000 - $100,000


Lenient sentence for a person who kills someone caught in the act of adultery.




 
In total, the Clinton Foundation brought in between $16.05 million and $40.1 million. That’s not a small number, but it’s nowhere near ""hundreds of millions."" Saudi Arabia is the clearest example of what Giuliani is talking about, and it donated a maximum of $25 million.
We should note that outside the narrow band of countries that ban women from driving and stone them for adultery, a few other countries with other women’s rights issues donated to the Clinton Foundation.
For example, Qatar, which donated between $1 million and $5 million, allows for flogging (non-lethal) as a punishment for adultery. And Brunei, which donated between $1 million and $5 million, specifically says spousal intercourse cannot be considered rape.
But even if you expand the group of foundation donors to countries that have significant women’s rights issues generally, the donations do not amount to ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars.
It’s also important to note Giuliani’s phrasing. He said, ""She's taken hundreds of millions from those countries,"" referring to Hillary Clinton herself.
But the donations did not go to Clinton personally; they went to the foundation. While Clinton has been intimately involved in the foundation when not serving in the government or running for office, neither Clinton nor her political campaigns have ever received a direct monetary benefit, such as a salary, from the foundation.
<strong",PolitiFact,"
Giuliani said Hillary Clinton has ""taken hundreds of millions from those countries"" where ""women are stoned, where women are killed for adultery and women can't drive.""
The Clinton Foundation, not Clinton personally, has taken in tens of millions of dollars, not hundreds of millions, from countries that have questionable records on women’s rights, including those that ban driving and stone women for adultery.
Giuliani’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

<p>One key caveat about Steube’s statement about dead people receiving health care benefits: Medicare and Medicaid payments are made to health care providers -- not the beneficiaries.</p>
<p>""No beneficiary receives a payment,"" said Joseph R. Antos, a health care and retirement policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.</p>
<p>Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said the category ""failure to verify death data"" is failure to check if people are dead, not necessarily that they are all dead.</p>
<p>Social Security <a href=""https://www.ssa.gov/dataexchange/request_dmf.html"">receives death information</a> from multiple sources, including family members, banks and other government agencies. Its ""Death Master File"" has 90 million records, but even then states it isn’t comprehensive of all deaths. The system isn’t perfect -- sometimes the <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/may/11/mark-warner/warner-says-millions-social-security-numbers-still/"">Social Security Administration</a> has prematurely declared a person dead. And not all federal agencies have the same access to death data, a problem some <a href=""https://www.peters.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/peters-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-curb-federal-improper-payments-to-deceased-people"">lawmakers want to rectify</a>.</p>
<p>While the $1 billion figure cited by Steube is large, it’s a small fraction of the total payments, Ellis said. For example, the Social Security improper payments rate in 2018 was 0.7% of total paid out, he said.</p>
<p>The federal government certainly can and should do better, Ellis said. But the situation doesn’t get fixed because it doesn’t add up to enough money to lead to an outcry to change it.</p>
<p>The<a href=""http://www.crfb.org/blogs/reducing-fraud-would-make-social-security-solvent""> Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget </a>found in 2016 that if Social Security could get rid of all improper payments, it would reduce costs by at most .6%.</p>

Holy Guacamole: Would America really ‘run out of avocados’ if Trump closes the border?

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>Late-night <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dZNl0xhFAg"">comedians</a> and news <a href=""https://www.delish.com/food-news/a27008482/avocado-shortage-us-mexico-border-closing/"">headlines</a> whipped up worries all week: Avocados could disappear ""in three weeks"" if President Trump shuts down the border.</p>
<p>""Holy lack-a-guacamole. No avocados! What are we supposed to put on our toast now, jelly?"" Stephen Colbert quipped on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.""</p>
<p>Yahoo! News captured the concern with this headline:</p>
<p>""The U.S. Would Run Out Of Avocados In Three Weeks If The Mexico Border Were To Actually Close""</p>
<p>Many other <a href=""https://www.wtap.com/content/news/America-would-run-out-of-avocados-in-three-weeks-if-Trump-shuts-down-the-US-Mexico-border-507985731.html"">outlets</a> and <a href=""https://www.travelandleisure.com/syndication/close-mexico-border-avocados"">blogs</a> reported the same alert, all citing President Trump’s threat to shut the border.</p>
<p>We wanted to know: Had these warnings served up the truth?</p>
<p>Couldn’t growers in California, a leading avocado producer, step in and replace the high-demand fruits in the case of a shut down?</p>
<p>We don’t typically examine predictions. But given Trump’s repeated <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1113437257493561344"">threats</a> to close the border and America’s avocado obsession, we decided the time was ripe for a fact check.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/avocado_Andrew_Nixon.jpg""><em>Avocados for sale at a Sacramento farmer's market / Capital Public Radio file photo</em></img></p>
<p><strong>Where did this claim start? </strong></p>
<p>The fears over an avocado vanishing started with a Reuters news <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-trump-consumer/avocado-shortages-virgin-margaritas-border-shutdown-would-hit-american-palates-idUSKCN1RD1XA"">article</a> on April 1. And, no, it wasn’t an April Fool’s joke.</p>
<p>""Americans would run out of avocados in three weeks if imports from Mexico were stopped, said Steve Barnard, president and chief executive of Mission Produce, the largest distributor and grower of avocados in the world,"" the article stated.</p>
<p>""You couldn’t pick a worse time of year because Mexico supplies virtually 100 percent of the avocados in the U.S. right now. California is just starting and they have a very small crop, but they’re not relevant right now and won’t be for another month or so,"" Barnard told Reuters.</p>
<p>We asked Mission Produce for more information but did not hear back.</p>
<p><strong>‘Vastly fewer avocados'</strong></p>
<p>Dan Sumner, an agricultural economist at the University of California at Davis, said the prediction about an avocado shortage is generally correct, given the nation’s reliance on Mexico, though it needs some context.</p>
<p>""Avocado demand has expanded so rapidly that we now import about 80 percent of the avocados we use in the United States,"" Sumner said. ""California produces almost all the rest, about 20 percent. And almost all the imports come from Mexico. A little bit from Chile and a few other places.""</p>
<p>Sumner said the claim assumes that Americans would continue to consume avocados at the same rapid pace we do now, even after a shut down.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>Price spikes, however, would cause demand to wither and some expensive avocados might be leftover, and stores might try to ration avocados, he added.</p>
<p>""Exactly what the retail strategy would be in this case, I’m not sure. But we would have vastly fewer avocados,"" Sumner said.</p>
<p>Just how fast avocados would disappear, if at all, would depend on whether the Trump administration enacts a full or partial border closure. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC he’s looking for ways to keep some commerce flowing.</p>
<p>""We are looking at different options, particularly if you can keep those freight lanes, the truck lanes, open,"" he said this week.  </p>
<p><strong>Grower’s perspective</strong></p>
<p>Ben Holtz owns Rocky H Ranch, a 70-acre family-run avocado farm in northern San Diego County. He agreed avocados would run out within weeks.</p>
<p>""Mexico is the big player today. California is not. You shut down the border and California can’t produce to meet the demand,"" Holtz said. ""There will be people without their guacamole.""</p>
<p>While Mexico’s avocado harvest is year-round, California’s is limited to April through July. Growers in the state have picked only about 3 percent of what’s expected to be a much smaller crop of about 175 million pounds this year, Holtz said. A heat wave last summer reduced the crop size.</p>
<p>California’s avocado harvest has averaged approximately 300 million pounds in recent years, according to <a href=""https://www.californiaavocadogrowers.com/industry/industry-statistical-data"">data </a>from the California Avocado Commission. By contrast, the U.S. has imported <a href=""https://mhaia.org/2018UpdateReport.pdf"">more than 1.5 billion pounds</a> of avocados from Mexico annually. Representatives from the commission did not respond to requests for this article.</p>
<p>Altogether, the U.S. received <a href=""https://migrationfiles.ucdavis.edu/uploads/farm-labor/2017/11/28/zahniser-us-produce-imports-from-mexico.pdf"">43 percent</a> of its fruit and vegetable imports from Mexico in 2016, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>Also affecting this year’s avocado supply, a California avocado company in March <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/business/avocado-recall-california.html"">recalled</a> shipments to six states last month after fears the fruit might be contaminated with a bacterium that can cause health risks.</p>
<p>Until the early 2000s, California was the nation’s leading supplier of avocados, Holtz said. Mexico gradually overtook the state and now dominates sales in the U.S.</p>
<p>""It’s a very big possibility,"" Holtz said of avocado shortages. ""Three weeks would dry up the Mexican inventory. California alone consumes more avocados than are grown in our state. Cold storage supply chain is basically three weeks or less of inventory. Most of the time it’s seven days.""</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the California Restaurant Association said ""we haven’t heard concerns from restaurants, it doesn’t mean they aren’t worried."" A national grocers association said it will ""continue to closely monitor any developments"" at the border, but did not have information about the potential impact on avocados.</p>
<p><strong>Our rating </strong></p>
<p>News outlets and blogs reported that the United States would ""run out of avocados in three weeks"" if President Trump shuts down the border.</p>
<p>America imports about 80 percent of its avocados, and most come from Mexico. California’s avocados, and those from Chile and other countries, account for the rest.</p>
<p>Experts agreed the Mexican inventory would run out within weeks. It’s possible, however, that price spikes would dampen demand for avocados and that customers willing to pay a hefty price would still find the celebrated fruit.</p>

</article>
</section>
</div>]","Late-night comedians and news headlines whipped up worries all week: Avocados could disappear ""in three weeks"" if President Trump shuts down the border.
""Holy lack-a-guacamole. No avocados! What are we supposed to put on our toast now, jelly?"" Stephen Colbert quipped on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.""
Yahoo! News captured the concern with this headline:
""The U.S. Would Run Out Of Avocados In Three Weeks If The Mexico Border Were To Actually Close""
Many other outlets and blogs reported the same alert, all citing President Trump’s threat to shut the border.
We wanted to know: Had these warnings served up the truth?
Couldn’t growers in California, a leading avocado producer, step in and replace the high-demand fruits in the case of a shut down?
We don’t typically examine predictions. But given Trump’s repeated threats to close the border and America’s avocado obsession, we decided the time was ripe for a fact check.
Avocados for sale at a Sacramento farmer's market / Capital Public Radio file photo
Where did this claim start? 
The fears over an avocado vanishing started with a Reuters news article on April 1. And, no, it wasn’t an April Fool’s joke.
""Americans would run out of avocados in three weeks if imports from Mexico were stopped, said Steve Barnard, president and chief executive of Mission Produce, the largest distributor and grower of avocados in the world,"" the article stated.
""You couldn’t pick a worse time of year because Mexico supplies virtually 100 percent of the avocados in the U.S. right now. California is just starting and they have a very small crop, but they’re not relevant right now and won’t be for another month or so,"" Barnard told Reuters.
We asked Mission Produce for more information but did not hear back.
‘Vastly fewer avocados'
Dan Sumner, an agricultural economist at the University of California at Davis, said the prediction about an avocado shortage is generally correct, given the nation’s reliance on Mexico, though it needs some context.
""Avocado demand has expanded so rapidly that we now import about 80 percent of the avocados we use in the United States,"" Sumner said. ""California produces almost all the rest, about 20 percent. And almost all the imports come from Mexico. A little bit from Chile and a few other places.""
Sumner said the claim assumes that Americans would continue to consume avocados at the same rapid pace we do now, even after a shut down.",PolitiFact,"
Price spikes, however, would cause demand to wither and some expensive avocados might be leftover, and stores might try to ration avocados, he added.
""Exactly what the retail strategy would be in this case, I’m not sure. But we would have vastly fewer avocados,"" Sumner said.
Just how fast avocados would disappear, if at all, would depend on whether the Trump administration enacts a full or partial border closure. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC he’s looking for ways to keep some commerce flowing.
""We are looking at different options, particularly if you can keep those freight lanes, the truck lanes, open,"" he said this week.

<p>In <a href=""https://archive.vn/eeByo"">a Jan. 25 interview</a> with the conservative Patriotically Correct Radio Show, Lin Wood, a defamation lawyer, said Biden’s presidency is a sham.</p>
<p>""I believe, without having definitive proof, that the military is in charge of our country, and I believe they are in charge of our country because Joe Biden is an illegal president,"" he said. ""And I believe the military has evidence that establishes that fact.""</p>
<p>Later in the video, Wood floats the theory that Biden has been signing blank pages or executive orders ""prepared for him by the people that control him."" The clip was published on Facebook and flagged as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

<p>We’ve <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/19/l-lin-wood/china-did-not-orchestrate-voter-fraud-2020-electio/"">previously fact-checked</a> false statements from Wood about the 2020 election, as well as rumors about <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/21/facebook-posts/biden-took-private-plane-his-inauguration-hes-stil/"">a military takeover</a> of the federal government.

<p>Biden is not an ""illegal president,"" and there is no evidence that the military is running the country.</p>
<p>Biden’s election was legal, and followed the process spelled out in <a href=""https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/"">Article II of the Constitution</a>.

</div>]","Nearly a week after President Joe Biden was inaugurated, supporters of Donald Trump are still spreading conspiracy theories that he isn’t actually running the country.
In a Jan. 25 interview with the conservative Patriotically Correct Radio Show, Lin Wood, a defamation lawyer, said Biden’s presidency is a sham.
""I believe, without having definitive proof, that the military is in charge of our country, and I believe they are in charge of our country because Joe Biden is an illegal president,"" he said. ""And I believe the military has evidence that establishes that fact.""
Later in the video, Wood floats the theory that Biden has been signing blank pages or executive orders ""prepared for him by the people that control him."" The clip was published on Facebook and flagged as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

(Screenshot from Facebook)
Wood was banned from Twitter in early January after he promoted the Capitol insurrection and false claims about the results of the 2020 presidential election. He has also promoted the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory; Wood’s claims about ""little children being abused, molested, and sacrificed"" by ""leaders in our government"" were aired on the Patriotically Correct Radio Show before his appearance.
We’ve previously fact-checked false statements from Wood about the 2020 election, as well as rumors about a military takeover of the federal government. So we wanted to take a look at this post, too.
Biden is not an ""illegal president,"" and there is no evidence that the military is running the country.
Biden’s election was legal, and followed the process spelled out in Article II of the Constitution. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have certified their election results, which Congress finalized on Jan. 7. Biden won 306 electoral votes, while Trump won 232. Since Biden got more than 270 electoral votes, he is the rightful president.",PolitiFact,"
Biden was duly sworn into office Jan. 20, after which he and first lady Jill Biden moved into the White House. Trump gave a farewell speech the same day.
There is no credible evidence that voter fraud affected the election outcome. Here’s how we know that:


Election officials in every state have said there was no sign of significant fraud during the voting process. 


The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency called the election ""the most secure in American history.""


The Justice Department said it uncovered no evidence of widespread fraud.


Not one of the lawsuits from Trump and his allies offered evidence that voter fraud affected the election outcome.


Before Inauguration Day, QAnon supporters said the military would take over the federal government instead of Biden becoming president. That did not come to pass, and the U.S. is not under a military dictatorship.
We reached out to Wood for a comment, but we haven’t heard back.
His statement is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!

<html><body><p>Col. Oleksandr ""Grey Wolf"" Oksanchenko was a Ukrainian Air Force display pilot who was killed in combat as he flew over Kyiv on Feb. 25, the day after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the Russian invasion into Ukraine.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky honored Oksanchenko three days later, designating him a ""Hero of Ukraine"" along with 11 other military service members, saying Oksanchenko ""died in an air battle, distracting enemy aircraft.""</p>
<p>But claims on social media have gone a step further, declaring that Oksanchenko is the rumored ""Ghost of Kyiv,"" the star of an unsubstantiated tale about an anonymous Ukrainian fighter pilot who allegedly took down six Russian fighter planes on the first day of the conflict. </p>
<p>""‘Ghost of Kyiv’ dies in combat,’"" read a headline that accompanied a photograph of Oksanchenko in a <a href=""https://archive.ph/UqFBm"">March 4 Facebook post</a>. ""Ukrainian stunt pilot Colonel Oleksandr 'Grey Wolf' Oksanchenko, who is known as the ‘Ghost of Kyiv’ for having downed seven Russian fighter jets, was shot down over the capital Kyiv on Friday night. … The famed Ukrainian pilot came out of retirement to defend his homeland from Russian invaders.""</p>

<p>Zelensky <a href=""https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zlo-ozbroyene-raketami-bombami-j-artileriyeyu-treba-zupiniti-73257"">gave a Feb. 28 address</a> in which he updated the public on the missile attack in Kharkiv, the defense of Kyiv and negotiations with Russia. He noted that he had signed a decree to award Oksanchenko the Hero of Ukraine title but did not mention or reference the Ghost of Kyiv. </p>
<p>It’s uncertain how the Ghost of Kyiv tale originated, but we know that Ukraine’s military <a href=""https://www.mil.gov.ua/en/news/2022/02/24/general-staff-of-the-armed-forces-of-ukraine-operative-information-as-of-10-30/"">reported on Feb. 24</a> that at least six Russian planes and two helicopters had been downed. Crediting Ukrainian military, <a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-23-22/h_27962509959744eadb2726026b5bde2a"">CNN</a> and <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/live-blog/russia-ukraine-conflict-live-updates-n1289655/ncrd1289705#blogHeader"">NBC</a> soon reported five Russian planes and one helicopter had been shot down. Russia’s defense ministry <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-russia-bases/update-1-russia-says-it-takes-out-ukraines-air-defences-air-bases-reports-idINL1N2UZ0K3"">denied the report</a>, according to Reuters, and said that Ukraine’s air force defenses had been ""suppressed."" </p>
<p>Ukraine’s official Twitter account, meanwhile, promoted the Ghost of Kyiv narrative with a <a href=""https://twitter.com/Ukraine/status/1497834538843660291"">video</a> that suggested the mystery pilot could have been responsible for as many as 10 downed Russian aircraft by Feb. 26. That video, too, <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/28/facebook-posts/ghost-kyiv-clip-video-game-not-video-fighting-ukra/"">included footage</a> from a video game. </p>
<p>PolitiFact did not receive a response from Zelensky’s administration about Oksanchenko and the Ghost of Kyiv claim.</p>
<p>Finding no conclusive information tying Oksanchenko to the Ghost of Kyiv, we rate this claim False. </p>

</div>]","Col. Oleksandr ""Grey Wolf"" Oksanchenko was a Ukrainian Air Force display pilot who was killed in combat as he flew over Kyiv on Feb. 25, the day after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the Russian invasion into Ukraine.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky honored Oksanchenko three days later, designating him a ""Hero of Ukraine"" along with 11 other military service members, saying Oksanchenko ""died in an air battle, distracting enemy aircraft.""
But claims on social media have gone a step further, declaring that Oksanchenko is the rumored ""Ghost of Kyiv,"" the star of an unsubstantiated tale about an anonymous Ukrainian fighter pilot who allegedly took down six Russian fighter planes on the first day of the conflict. 
""‘Ghost of Kyiv’ dies in combat,’"" read a headline that accompanied a photograph of Oksanchenko in a March 4 Facebook post. ""Ukrainian stunt pilot Colonel Oleksandr 'Grey Wolf' Oksanchenko, who is known as the ‘Ghost of Kyiv’ for having downed seven Russian fighter jets, was shot down over the capital Kyiv on Friday night. … The famed Ukrainian pilot came out of retirement to defend his homeland from Russian invaders.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
While the story of the Ghost of Kyiv has been celebrated online as an example of Ukraine’s fierce defiance in the face of Russian aggression, there so far has been nothing official to substantiate its details. Many of the online claims promoting the Ghost of Kyiv narrative have featured video game footage and old, unrelated photos.",PolitiFact,"
Zelensky gave a Feb. 28 address in which he updated the public on the missile attack in Kharkiv, the defense of Kyiv and negotiations with Russia. He noted that he had signed a decree to award Oksanchenko the Hero of Ukraine title but did not mention or reference the Ghost of Kyiv. 
It’s uncertain how the Ghost of Kyiv tale originated, but we know that Ukraine’s military reported on Feb. 24 that at least six Russian planes and two helicopters had been downed. Crediting Ukrainian military, CNN and NBC soon reported five Russian planes and one helicopter had been shot down. Russia’s defense ministry denied the report, according to Reuters, and said that Ukraine’s air force defenses had been ""suppressed."" 
Ukraine’s official Twitter account, meanwhile, promoted the Ghost of Kyiv narrative with a video that suggested the mystery pilot could have been responsible for as many as 10 downed Russian aircraft by Feb. 26. That video, too, included footage from a video game. 
PolitiFact did not receive a response from Zelensky’s administration about Oksanchenko and the Ghost of Kyiv claim.
Finding no conclusive information tying Oksanchenko to the Ghost of Kyiv, we rate this claim False.

<p>The final presidential debate between former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump may have had fewer interruptions, but it wasn’t any more truthful. It was similar to the first debate, in that Trump’s comments needed more fact-checking than Biden’s.</p>
<p>The claims came thick and fast about the coronavirus, immigration, health care and race issues. Let’s get right to the fact-checks.</p>

<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: ""We are rounding the turn (on coronavirus). We are rounding the corner.""</strong></div>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/23/donald-trump/no-fight-against-coronavirus-isnt-rounding-corner-/"">False.</a> </strong>""Rounding the corner"" suggests that significant and sustained improvements are being made in the fight against the virus, and that’s not the case, according to the data.</p>
<p>The number of coronavirus cases is climbing once again, after falling consistently between late July and mid-September. Cases are now at their highest point since early August, with almost 60,000 new confirmed infections a day. That’s only about 10% lower than the peak in late July.</p>

<p><em>(New coronavirus cases per 100,000 people, USA Facts)</em></p>
<p>Hospitalizations today are lower than in previous spikes, but in the past few weeks, there has been a <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/oct/22/covid-numbers-status-report/"">modest increase</a>. The positivity rate, which measures what percentage of tests come up positive for the virus, <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/oct/22/covid-numbers-status-report/"">is also going up</a> again during the past few weeks. Higher positivity rates are an indicator of community spread.</p>
<p>The one encouraging change is that, since a peak in August, deaths have fallen fairly consistently, due to a combination of factors, including improved understanding of how to treat the disease. Yet deaths have settled in at about 800 a day, keeping total deaths per week in the United States above normal levels.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: His administration has done ""everything"" Biden suggested to address COVID-19. ""He was way behind us."" </strong></div>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/13/mike-pence/pence-said-biden-copied-trumps-pandemic-response-p/"">We rated a similar claim Pants on Fire.</a> </strong>While there are some similarities between both Biden’s and Trump’s plans to combat COVID-19, experts told us any pandemic response plan should have certain core strategies. The Trump administration has released no comprehensive plan to combat COVID-19, except in regard to the development and distribution of vaccines. Trump’s main intervention was implementing travel restrictions, while efforts to roll out a widespread testing plan faced difficulties. </p>
<p>Biden released a public COVID-19 plan — the first draft was published on <a href=""https://www.vox.com/2020/3/12/21177099/joe-biden-coronavirus-covid-19-plan"">March 12, 2020</a>. It included public health measures such as deploying free testing and personal protective equipment, as well as implementing economic measures such as emergency paid leave and state and local emergency funds.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: ""As you know, 2.2 million people were expected to die. We closed the greatest economy in the world to fight this horrible disease that came from China.""  </strong></div>
<p><strong>His claim about the estimated deaths rates <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/21/donald-trump/trump-says-he-prevented-2-million-covid-19-deaths-/"">Mostly False.</a> </strong>Trump frequently refers to this number to claim that his administration’s moves saved 2 million lives. However, the number is from a mathematical model that hypothesized what would happen if, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., people continued to live their daily lives as normal, and neither people or governments changed their behaviors, a scenario that experts consider unrealistic. The U.S. also has the highest death toll from COVID-19 of any country in the world, and one of the highest death rates. Credit for shutting down the economy also doesn’t primarily go to Trump, but rather to states and local jurisdictions. In fact, Trump encouraged states to open back up beginning in May, even when there were high rates of COVID-19 transmission in those areas. </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: ""We cannot lock ourselves in a basement like Joe does.""</strong></div>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/04/jason-miller/biden-isnt-basement-trump-campaign-keeps-saying-so/"">We rated a similar claim False.</a> </strong>It is one of Trump’s favored shots to say Biden isolated himself in his basement. In the first few months of the pandemic, Biden did run much of his campaign from his Delaware home. He built a TV studio set in his basement to interact with voters virtually. But that changed.</p>
<p>In September, Biden held events in Kenosha, Wis.; Lancaster, Pa.; Warren, Mich.; Tampa, Fla.,;Charlotte, N.C, and more. We counted 14 locations.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: Says Dr. Anthony Fauci ""is a Democrat, but that's OK.""</strong></div>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/oct/21/donald-trumps-claims-about-dr-anthony-fauci-fact-c/"">This is wrong</a>. </strong>Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is not affiliated with any political party. He also hasn’t endorsed any parties or candidates.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Biden: ""We are in a circumstance where the president still has no plan, no comprehensive plan."" </strong></div>
<p><strong>This is largely accurate. </strong>When Biden claimed <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/sep/17/fact-checking-joe-biden-coronavirus-vaccine/"">during the first debate</a> that Trump ""still won’t offer a plan,"" we noted the Trump administration’s ""Operation Warp Speed"" for vaccine development as well as its more detailed plan for vaccine distribution. But <a href=""https://khn.org/news/fact-check-mike-pence-debate-biden-plagiarized-trump-administration-pandemic-response-plan/"">the administration has not released </a>a comprehensive plan to address COVID-19.</p>

<p><em>(AP)</em></p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Biden: Schools ""need a lot of money to open"" and Trump ""refused to support that money, or at least up until now.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>This needs context. </strong>Biden appears to be referring to a revised <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr925/BILLS-116hr925eah.pdf"">stimulus package</a> the House passed Oct. 1. The measure would allocate a total of $225 billion to ""support the educational needs of states, schools districts, and institutions in response to coronavirus,"" according to a <a href=""https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/democrats.appropriations.house.gov/files/Updated%20Heroes%20Act%20Summary.pdf"">summary</a> from Democratic staff on the House Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p>Trump <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313551795646541824?s=20"">tweeted</a> Oct. 6 that he instructed representatives to stop negotiating on that bill until after the election. He has since expressed interest in passing more relief, even floating the idea of a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/15/business/us-economy-coronavirus"">more expensive bill</a>. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-usa-congress/update-6-pelosi-white-house-see-progress-on-covid-19-aid-talks-senate-republicans-wary-idUSL1N2HD0KX"">said</a> he’s been ""all over the map.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: ""There was a spike in Florida. That is gone. There was a spike in Texas. That is gone. There was a spike in Arizona. It is gone."" </strong></div>
<p><strong>This is inaccurate.</strong> Over the summer, Florida, Texas and Arizona experienced record surges in cases that later eased — but now they are all seeing new surges. Over the past week, the New York Times’ <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/arizona-coronavirus-cases.html"">tracker</a> notes, the daily average of new infections is up 29% in Florida, 16% in Texas, and 55% in Arizona, compared with the daily average two weeks earlier.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Trump: ""When I closed (travel from China) he said I should not have closed. ... He said this is a terrible thing, you are a xenophobe, I think he called me racist. Now he says I should have closed it earlier.""</div>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/23/donald-trump/trump-repeats-flawed-claim-biden-opposed-trumps-co/"">Mostly False</a>. </strong>Joe Biden did not directly say that he thought that Trump shouldn’t have restricted travel from China to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Biden did accuse Trump of ""xenophobia"" in an Iowa campaign speech the same day that the administration announced the travel restrictions — Jan. 31 — but his campaign said his remarks were not related, and that he made similar comments before the restrictions were imposed. Biden didn’t take a definitive stance on the subject until April 3, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/26/trumps-faux-facts-fox-news/"">when his campaign said</a> that he supported Trump’s decision to impose travel restrictions on China.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><a name=""Health care""></a>HEALTH CARE</div>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: ""They have 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine, you won’t even have a choice, they want to terminate 180 million plans."" </strong></div>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/23/donald-trump/trumps-misguided-claim-bidens-health-plan-will-ter/"">Pants on Fire</a>. </strong>There are about 180 million people with private health insurance. But there is absolutely no evidence that under Biden’s health care proposal all 180 million would be removed from their insurance plans. Biden supports creating a public option, which would be a government-run insurance program, that would exist alongside and compete with other private plans on the health insurance marketplace.</p>
<p>Under Biden’s plan, even people with employer-sponsored coverage could choose a public plan if they wanted. And estimates show that only a small percentage of Americans would likely leave their employer sponsored coverage if a public option were available, and certainly not all 180 million. Experts said it is not socialized medicine.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Biden: ""Not one single person with private insurance"" lost their insurance ""under Obamacare … unless they chose they wanted to go to something else.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>This is inaccurate. </strong>It's a variation of a claim that earned President Barack Obama our <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2013/dec/12/lie-year-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-keep-it/"">Lie of the Year in 2013</a>. The Affordable Care Act tried to allow existing health plans to continue under a complicated process called ""grandfathering,"" but if the plans deviated even a little, they would lose their grandfathered status. And if that happened, insurers canceled plans that didn’t meet the new standards.</p>
<p>No one determined with any certainty how many people got cancellation notices, but analysts <a href=""https://www.propublica.org/article/health-policy-canceled-what-we-know-and-dont-know"">estimated</a> that about 4 million or more had their plans canceled. Many found insurance elsewhere, and the percentage was small — out of a <a href=""http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/"">total</a> insured population of about 262 million, the number of people with canceled plans was less than 2%. However, that still amounted to 4 million people who faced the difficulty of finding a new plan and the hassle of switching their coverage.</p>

<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: ""Joe got $3.5 million from Russia that came through Putin because he was friendly with the mayor of Moscow, and it was his wife.""</strong></div>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/sep/30/examining-trump-claim-hunter-biden-got-35-million-/"">This is both misstated and lacks hard evidence</a>. </strong>When Trump first made this claim, he said Biden’s son Hunter Biden received the money. Extending the charge to the former vice president lacks any proof whatsoever. But here’s what we know about the origin of this claim.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/oct/19/looking-claims-about-hunter-biden-and-senate-gop-r/"">A report issued by the Republican majority</a> on the Senate Finance and Homeland Security committees said Hunter Biden and his business partner Devon Archer had a financial relationship with Elena Baturina, the widow of a man who had been mayor of Moscow until 2010. As its source, the report cites undisclosed documents. Without seeing the documents the Republicans have relied on, this accusation remains unproven.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden’s lawyer said Biden did not get $3.5 million from Baturina and that the report has a key error. Democratic staff on the committees said they have seen all the documents and that no information in the committees’ possession shows that Hunter Biden had any financial interest in the transaction.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Biden: President Donald Trump ""has a secret bank account in China.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>There is accurate.</strong> A major report from the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/trump-taxes-china.html"">New York Times</a> showed a previously unknown account that remained open as of the publication of the story on Oct. 20. Trump’s attorney, Alan Garten, confirmed its existence.</p>
<p>According to the Times, Trump’s returns show that he has maintained bank accounts in three foreign countries — the United Kingdom, Ireland and China. They had not been listed in Trump’s candidate financial disclosure forms. The China account was in the name of a Trump-owned subsidiary, Trump International Hotels Management LLC. The leaked returns showed that $188,561 was paid from the account to cover taxes to the China government between 2013 to 2015.</p>
<p>Garten told the Times that the company had opened an account with a Chinese bank in order to pay local taxes associated with efforts to explore possible hotel deals in Asia, but that no deals materialized. </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: ""I closed"" my Chinese bank account ""before I even ran for president."" </strong></div>
<p><strong>This is misleading. </strong>Trump’s own lawyer was quoted in the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/trump-taxes-china.html"">New York Times article</a> that revealed the existence of the bank account, and he said that ""the bank account remains open.""</p>
<p>Garten told the newspaper that the account had been opened to ""pay the local taxes"" associated with efforts to strike hotel deals in Asia, and that when ""no deals, transactions or other business activities ever materialized,"" the account has remained ""inactive"" since 2015. The Times’ investigation confirmed tax payments made from the account from 2013 to 2018.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Biden: Trump’s ""own national security adviser told him what is happening with his buddy Rudy Giuliani. He’s being used as a Russian pawn. He’s being fed information that’s not true.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>This is disputed.</strong> <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/giuliani-biden-ukraine-russian-disinformation/2020/10/15/43158900-0ef5-11eb-b1e8-16b59b92b36d_story.html"">The Washington Post</a> reported that Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, warned Trump in 2019 that his personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, was the target of a Russian disinformation campaign in Ukraine and that any information he brought back from the country should be viewed with skepticism. In December 2019, Giuliani went to Ukraine in an attempt to gather evidence of corruption by Biden and his son Hunter. The Post report quotes four former intelligence officials who said that Giuliani was seen interacting with people affiliated with Russian intelligence agencies on the trip. One of these former officials said that Trump ""shrugged his shoulders"" and seemed to discount O’Brien’s warning. However, in a written statement, National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot told the Post that its characterization of the meeting with O’Brien was ""not accurate.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Biden: Speaking of his work in Ukraine while his son was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, ""Nothing was unethical. ... I carried out U.S. policy. Not one single solitary thing was out of line.""</strong></div>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/sep/23/president-donald-trump-ukraine-biden-whistleblower/"">This oversimplifies</a></strong>. Hunter Biden’s position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company when Biden was vice president has long raised ethical questions for foreign policy experts. </p>
<p>""It was a mistake for Hunter Biden to join the Burisma board, particularly given that the vice president was the senior U.S. official engaging Ukraine. Hunter Biden should have been more mindful of his father's position,"" <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/sep/23/president-donald-trump-ukraine-biden-whistleblower/"">said</a> Steven Pifer, a career foreign service officer who was ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton and a deputy assistant secretary of state under President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Obama White House responded by saying members of the Biden family were ""private citizens and where they work does not reflect an endorsement by the administration or by the Vice President or President."" </p>
<p>When Biden launched his presidential campaign, his Republican critics pointed to a meeting he had in Ukraine in 2016 that led to the ouster of the country’s top prosecutor while the energy company was under investigation. But Biden was representing the administration's position in seeking the prosecutors removal, and he later boasted about the meeting, so it was no secret. Biden told Ukraine’s president that a $1 billion loan guarantee was at stake unless the prosecutor left, a demand also supported by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong><a name=""economy""></a>ECONOMY</strong></div>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Biden: Trump ""has caused the deficit with China to go up, not down.""</strong></div>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/30/joe-biden/joe-biden-base-debate-attack-over-us-china-trade-d/"">Mostly False</a>. </strong>The <a href=""https://www.bea.gov/data/intl-trade-investment/international-trade-goods-and-services"">U.S. trade deficit with China in goods and services</a>, the broadest measurement of the balance of trade, was smaller under Trump in 2019, the most recent full year, than it was in any of the final three years of the Obama administration. </p>
<p>Biden’s campaign pointed to a narrower measure — trade in <a href=""https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html"">goods only</a> — which shows that the trade deficit with China has generally been higher under Trump than it was under Obama. But even here, the U.S. made progress under Trump in 2019 in whittling down the goods deficit.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-ad-distorts-bidens-record-social-secu/"">This distorts the record.</a> </strong>Biden has offered a variety of Social Security plans. Starting in the 1970s, he called for an increase in monthly benefits, then for a one-year freeze, then floated raising the retirement age, then backed a change in how benefits would increase. Today, he calls for higher monthly checks for the oldest beneficiaries.</p>
<p>In the 1980s and 1990s, Biden spoke in favor of Social Security freezes  to rein in spending and reduce the deficit. Biden’s point was that no part of the government would be exempt from the effort to balance the budget.</p>
<p>As vice president during the Obama administration, Biden generally focused on protecting Social Security, and resisted moves to privatize it.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Biden: If Trump ends the payroll tax, ""Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to make up for it.""</strong></div>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/04/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-donald-trumps-plan-get-rid-payroll-/"">This needs context</a>. </strong>The Social Security chief actuary <a href=""https://www.ssa.gov/oact/solvency/VanHollenSandersWydenSchumer_20200824.pdf"">did say</a> that if the Social Security portion of the payroll tax were eliminated, the program would run out of money in three years. However, the chief actuary added that he was unaware of any plan to end the payroll tax, and the Trump campaign has said there is no plan to do so.</p>
<p>The White House <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/live-blog/2020-10-22-trump-biden-election-n1244210/ncrd1244437#liveBlogHeader"">has said</a> that Trump favors something more limited: to forgive the taxes that would have been due from a four-month payroll tax holiday he enacted by executive order to ease the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has also <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/"">mused</a> <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-081320/"">about</a> terminating the tax, which would put the program under great financial strain. </p>
<p>However, Trump also said he would look to Congress to maintain the program in that scenario by drawing on general revenues — potentially in excess of $1 trillion a year. The actuary said that if that approach were taken, it would leave benefits essentially unaffected. Even if Trump wanted to eliminate the payroll tax, he couldn’t accomplish it unilaterally; he’d need Congress to go along.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong><a name=""race""></a>RACE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE</strong></div>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: Says Biden called Black Americans ""superpredators"" when he wrote his 1994 crime bill.</strong></div>
<p><strong>No evidence. </strong>In 1993, Biden gave a speech on the Senate floor in which he said the country should focus on young people who had no supervision or opportunities. Otherwise, they’d ""become the predators 15 years from now,"" he said. Biden did not single out Black Americans.</p>
<p>""Madam President, we have predators on our streets, and society has in fact, because of its neglect, created that,"" he said, <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/103/crecb/1993/11/18/GPO-CRECB-1993-pt21-2-2.pdf"">according to the Congressional Record</a>.</p>
<p>The term ""superpredators"" refers to something Hillary Clinton said in 1996 when referring to a ""gang of kids."" She did not specifically say superpredators were Black Americans, but decades later Clinton apologized for the comment.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Biden: Under the Obama administration ""38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison."" </strong></div>
<p><strong>This is misleading. </strong>Biden’s campaign pointed to <a href=""https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p18.pdf"">Bureau of Justice Statistics data </a>showing the federal prison population was 179,898 in 2018, down about 38,000 from a peak of 217,815 in 2012. The 38,000 figure was cited in a <a href=""http://civilrightsdocs.info/pdf/policy/letters/2018/Support-Letter-on-First%20Step%20Act-%28ACLU-and-The-Leadership-Conference%29-12.17.18-FINAL.pdf"">letter by the ACLU</a> sent to Senate leadership at the end of 2018.</p>
<p>But that statistic reflects only the net change in the federal prison population, not the number of people who were released. Moreover, it cherrypicks the high point during Obama’s tenure, and compares it with a year during Trump’s tenure. </p>
<p>A better measure is to compare the number of federal prisoners in 2008, the year before Obama became president, with his final year. Federal statistics show there were 201,280 federal prisoners in 2008 compared with 189,192 in 2016, a decline of about 12,088.</p>

<p><em>(USA Facts)</em></p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: ""Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Historians dispute this. </strong>The claim overstates Trump’s own standing within history, <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/aug/01/donald-trump-said-hes-done-more-african-americans-/"">historians say</a>. President Lyndon B. Johnson, a skilled legislator from his years in the Senate, deliberately crafted his civil rights agenda and pushed it through Congress with personal persuasion. President Harry Truman moved to desegregate the military, and even President Richard Nixon, who was <a href=""https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/tapes-reveal-nixon-s-racist-remarks-1.2535505"">captured on tape</a> making racist remarks, advanced the desegregation of schools and affirmative action in employment.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: ""President Obama would never give them long-term funding, and I did … I saved historically Black colleges and universities.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>This is an exaggeration. </strong>When Trump signed the bipartisan <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/5363/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22future%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1&amp;s=4"">FUTURE Act</a> in 2019, he did make permanent $255 million in annual funding for minority-serving colleges, including roughly $85 million allocated to historically Black colleges and universities under a Title-III program. But Trump can’t claim he gave them more money than Obama did, or that he ""saved"" them.</p>
<p>HBCUs got money via the same program every year while Obama was president, according to the U.S. Education Department. Trump’s budget proposals for the <a href=""https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget18/18action.pdf#page=11"">last</a> <a href=""https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget19/19action.pdf#page=10"">three</a> <a href=""https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget20/20action.pdf#page=10"">years</a> show that the White House repeatedly requested less in discretionary funding through the program than Congress provided. </p>
<p>Two experts crunched the numbers on HBCU funding for PolitiFact using <a href=""https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/"">data from the National Center for Education Statistics</a>. Ivory Toldson, a Howard University professor who served as an HBCU liaison for the Obama administration, said HBCUs got $1.9 billion from the federal government in appropriations, grants and contracts in 2017-18, compared with between $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion annually under Obama.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong><a name=""immigration""></a>IMMIGRATION</strong></div>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: ""We changed the policy."" The Obama administration ""built the cages.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>This needs context. </strong>Both the Obama and Trump administrations used chain-link enclosures to hold immigrants at border processing facilities. The term ""cages"" has been used by Trump critics to describe this type of enclosure.</p>
<p>The claim about cages came during a question about family separations at the southwest border. The separations occurred under the Trump administration’s ""zero-tolerance"" policy to prosecute all adults crossing the border illegally, while their children were sent to the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, which placed them with sponsors (such as family members), in shelters, or foster homes.</p>
<p>The Obama administration <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/jun/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-again-falsely-says-obama-had-family-s/"">did not have a policy to separate families</a> arriving illegally at the border.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Biden: ""These 500-plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>This checks out. </strong>There are 545 children separated from their parents for whom lawyers and immigrant advocacy groups have ""not yet reached the separated parent,"" said a <a href=""http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/10/20/ms_l_v_us_immigration_and_customs_enforcement__casdce-18-00428__0556.0.pdf"">court document</a> filed this week related to litigation about family separations at the southwest border. </p>
<p>The children are among 1,500 who were separated from their parents and whose cases were discovered later through litigation. Some of the separations happened under a pilot program that began in mid-2017.</p>
<p>The Trump administration in April 2018 announced and expanded its ""zero-tolerance"" policy, the driver of the family separations. After public backlash, a federal judge <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/jun/29/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-right-there-was-no-plan-reuniting-fa/"">ordered</a> the Trump administration to stop separating families and to reunite the children it had in custody with their families. The Trump administration identified about 2,700 such children.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: ""We are trying very hard"" to reunite 545 children taken at the border whose parents have not been located.</strong></div>
<p><strong>This needs context. </strong>The government isn't working alone. A court-appointed steering committee of lawyers and immigrant advocates is working to unify families. The Trump campaign pointed to an Oct. 21 <a href=""https://twitter.com/SpoxDHS/status/1319002785262784513"">statement</a> by the Department of Homeland Security that ""DHS has taken every step to facilitate the reunification of these families where the parents wanted such reunification to occur."" </p>
<p>Efforts to locate the parents have been hampered by COVID-19, the committee’s <a href=""http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/10/20/ms_l_v_us_immigration_and_customs_enforcement__casdce-18-00428__0556.0.pdf"">court document</a> said. But  ""limited on-the-ground efforts"" have resumed where safe.</p>
<p>The committee also established toll-free telephone numbers in the United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and El Salvador to field calls from parents, and publicized them through non-governmental organizations and other community organizations in the United States and Spanish-language media outlets. The committee sent letters in Spanish and English to about 1,600 addresses provided by the government for those who had not yet been reached.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><a name=""Climate change""></a>CLIMATE CHANGE</div>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Biden: ""I have never said that I oppose fracking.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>This one is messy</strong>. Biden has misstated his own position at least once in the past, but his opponents have taken that misstatement and wrongly presented it as his position.</p>
<p>Biden’s position is that the United States needs to transition away from fossil fuels, but he doesn’t want to ban fracking outright. Instead, he opposes fracking on public lands and wants to stop the federal government from <a href=""https://joebiden.com/climate/"">issuing new permits for drilling</a>. He says that he’ll allow fracking to continue on private lands, where most of it takes place.</p>
<p>Biden did <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/25/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-claim-biden-would-immediately/"">misspeak</a> during a debate with Bernie Sanders in March 2020 when he said he supported a ban on ""new fracking."" He walked back those remarks the same day and has repeatedly said since then that he doesn’t support a ban on fracking right now.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: ""Look, their real (climate) plan costs $100 trillion.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>We rated a similar claim <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/mar/12/joni-ernst/joni-ernst-says-green-new-deal-would-cost-93-trill/"">False</a>. </strong>Right before Trump talked about Biden’s ""real plan,"" he named Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., a prime architect of the Green New Deal proposal. Trump invariably says that is Biden’s true climate change policy.</p>
<p>It isn’t, although Biden’s website describes the Green New Deal as a ""crucial framework."" Biden’s plan aims for net-zero carbon emissions no later than 2050.</p>
<p>The $100 trillion figure applies to the Green New Deal. It’s based on a report by the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. That report puts the cost at somewhere between $51 trillion and $93 trillion. The largest expenses are for non-environmental parts of the proposal: $36 trillion for universal health care and up to to $44.6 trillion for guaranteed union jobs with a family-sustaining wage. Whatever the similarities between Biden’s climate plan and the Green New Deal, Biden's plan doesn’t include the non-environmental elements. Without those pieces, there’s no way to get to the high-end estimates.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Biden: ""He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Trump has said this. </strong>When Trump suggested the noise of wind turbines causes cancer in April 2019, we rated that <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/apr/08/donald-trump/republicans-dismiss-trumps-windmill-and-cancer-cla/"">Pants on Fire</a>.</p>
<p>""If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations, your house just went down 75% in value,"" Trump said at a National Republican Congressional Committee fundraiser. ""And they say the noise causes cancer.""</p>
<p>There are no studies that support Trump’s statement that windmills and cancer are somehow linked. When we looked for evidence <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/apr/08/donald-trump/republicans-dismiss-trumps-windmill-and-cancer-cla/"">in 2019</a>, we found a report from the Australian Parliament’s Select Committee on Wind Turbines. The report found anecdotal reports of discomfort from people who lived near windmills, and the list of ailments it heard was long. But no one complained of cancer. In <a href=""https://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/senate/wind_turbines/wind_turbines/Final%20Report/c02"">its final 2015 report</a>, the committee said more evidence was needed to establish a link to any illness.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: ""The fumes coming up to make these massive windmills is more than anything that we are talking about with natural gas.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>This gets things backwards. </strong>Wind comes with much lower greenhouse gas emissions than natural gas.</p>
<p>Energy analysts can tease out the greenhouse gas emissions for the entire life cycle of any source of power. According to the <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/conference/2015/pdf/presentations/skone.pdf"">U.S. Energy Department</a>, natural gas produces 22 times more than wind power. Researchers at <a href=""https://www.climatexchange.org.uk/media/1459/life_cycle_wind_-_executive_summary_.pdf"">Edinburgh University in Scotland</a> reached the same conclusion after reviewing a number of studies of emissions from windmills: ""Despite variations in estimated carbon footprint of wind power generation, it is significant to note they are all significantly lower than for fossil fuelled generation,"" they wrote.</p>
<p>A life cycle analysis looks at every step in the production of power, from making the equipment, to the daily production of electricity, to the final use of the equipment at the end of its useful life. Even though the steps are totally different for natural gas and wind power — the great majority of a windmill’s emissions come in making the equipment and erecting the towers — the final comparison can be apples-to-apples.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><a name=""The campaign""></a><strong>THE CAMPAIGN</strong></div>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: In 2016, ""we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>This is slightly exaggerated</strong>. Trump did trail Clinton in the money race, and his ability to win despite that shortfall was notable. However, Trump had access to more than a ""tiny fraction"" of Clinton’s war chest.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign directly <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16"">raised</a> $333.1 million in 2016, which was just shy of 60% of the total that Clinton raised, $563.8 million.</p>
<p>If you combine the amounts that each campaign raised with the amounts raised by independent groups aligned with that candidate as well as their <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/index.php?cmte=&amp;cycle=2016"">national party committees</a>, Trump and his allies were able to count on about $1.4 billion, which was about 68% of the $2.06 billion Clinton raised. </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: ""They spied on my campaign.""</strong></div>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-repeats-false-claim-obama-spied-his-c/"">False</a>. </strong>No evidence has surfaced to suggest Obama or Biden ever <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-repeats-false-claim-obama-spied-his-c/"">spied on Trump’s campaign</a>, ordered a <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/21/facebook-posts/facebook-post-comparing-obama-allegations-watergat/"">wiretap on Trump Tower</a>, or initiated or meddled in the FBI’s work looking into possible coordination between members of Trump’s campaign and Russia.</p>
<p>The wiretapping claim has been dismissed as unsubstantiated by lawmakers from both parties, intelligence officials and the Justice Department. </p>
<p>As part of the Russia probe later led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the FBI investigated four men in the Trump campaign’s orbit. A report from Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz concluded that the investigation was justified and not politically motivated.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Trump: Biden ""doesn’t come from Scranton … He lived there for a short period of time before he even knew it, and he left.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>This is <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/29/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-frequent-claim-joe-biden-aban/"">Pants on Fire</a>. </strong>Biden spent his early youth in Scranton, living there for a decade and attending Catholic school. He was 10 years old when his family moved to Wilmington, Del., but he continued to spend most summers and holidays with his mother’s family there.</p>
<p>Biden has <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/may/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-joe-biden-abandoned-scranton/"">maintained ties</a> to Pennsylvania in the years since, <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/29/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-frequent-claim-joe-biden-aban/"">returning</a> for everything from commencement speeches and little league games to fundraisers and floods. Although he represented Delaware, he was sometimes called Pennsylvania’s ""third senator"" due to his attention to legislation affecting the state.</p>

<p>The law increased funding and provided additional legal tools for combating violent crimes committed against women. The law has been reauthorized in 2000, 2005, and 2013, and it expired in the recent government shutdown. It must now be reauthorized, which Biden urged lawmakers to do quickly.</p>

<p>We have previously looked at a similar assertion. In 2013, Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., cited a drop of 67 percent since passage. We found official Justice Department <a href=""https://bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ipv9310.pdf"">data</a> from 2010 showing that it had fallen 63 percent by then, so we rated the statement <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/13/gwen-moore/94-law-domestic-violence-down-two-thirds-us-democr/"">Mostly True</a>.</p>
<p>But that was more than six years ago. What does the current data say? Biden appears to be in the ballpark, though when we discussed the data with domestic violence experts, they offered a few caveats.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Recent data is lacking</div>
<p>As it happens, the data hasn’t advanced very much.</p>
<p>There hasn’t been any equivalent data published for the years beyond <a href=""https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ndv0312.pdf"">2012</a>. In 2012, the domestic violence rate was slightly higher than it was in 2010, so the drop between 1994 and 2012 was about 60 percent. This was the report that Biden’s office pointed as evidence to when we contacted them.</p>
<p>More recent data — related, but distinct — suggests that at least one subset of domestic violence, intimate partner homicide, may actually be experiencing a modest upswing.</p>
<p>According to a paper now being finalized by Northeastern University criminologists Emma E. Fridel and James Alan Fox, homicides by intimate partners have risen modestly since about 2014, both for men and women as victims. Here’s a chart from the forthcoming paper:</p>

<p>While the frequency of intimate partner homicide is well below where it was in the early 1990s, Fox said, ""there has been a recent uptick, particularly with guns.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">How much credit goes to the law?</div>
<p>The second caveat concerns cause and effect.</p>
<p>It would stand to reason that the law did help bring down the domestic violence rate. But it may not have been the only factor.</p>
<p>Biden’s statement ""implies causation, when all we have is correlation,"" said Leigh Goodmark, a law professor at the University of Maryland Carey School of Law, where she launched the Gender Violence Clinic.</p>
<p>Goodmark noted that the decline in domestic violence has paralleled a similarly steep decline in overall violent crime. This makes it hard to determine how much of the decline in domestic violence is due to the law and how much is due to broader societal trends.</p>
<p>Here’s a chart from the Justice Department showing the trend lines for all violent crime and for all intimate partner violence between 1993 and 2010:</p>
<p><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OR4EXsVHG-GKCIrQ73j-l6-Vt4qvtGn6u8ZecY6QWxYQ42jmiV13qTVreH2IKrW_jsiSp8wTg64Kw04hgCyZEg_AWD3bQMZ1tSPbIvtscaOPTJxUIHv71TOF0w4yiHcAyeaZUT1L""/></p>
<p><em>Source: U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics</em></p>
<p>Goodmark added a related point: Most of the decline occurred prior to 2000. Between 2000 and 2010, by contrast, the domestic violence rate essentially stagnated.</p>
<p>""At the same time that, through the Violence Against Women Act, we’re putting hundreds of millions of dollars into the criminal legal response to domestic violence, the rate of domestic violence fell less than the overall crime rate fell,"" she said. ""What’s remarkable is that domestic violence is stubbornly resistant to falling even when the overall crime rate is still falling significantly.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>Biden said, ""Since the passage of (the Violence Against Women Act), annual rates of domestic violence have dropped by 63%.""</p>
<p>He’s close on the percentage, which was 60 percent between 1994 and 2012. However, this data should be treated cautiously because it is six years old, and it’s unclear whether the decline is due to the law itself or to the broad, societal decline in all types of violent crime since the early 1990s. And after 2000, as violent crime continued to fall, the domestic violence rate remained about the same.</p>

</div>]","Joe Biden championed the Violence Against Women Act as a Democratic senator from Delaware in 1994. Two and a half decades and two terms as vice president later, he’s still touting the law and its impact as he considers whether to run for president in 2020.
The law increased funding and provided additional legal tools for combating violent crimes committed against women. The law has been reauthorized in 2000, 2005, and 2013, and it expired in the recent government shutdown. It must now be reauthorized, which Biden urged lawmakers to do quickly.
""Since the passage of VAWA, annual rates of domestic violence have dropped by 63%,"" Biden tweeted Feb. 15. ""The National Domestic Violence Hotline responds to more than 26,000 people a month, creating a safety net for survivors. We have made progress, but there is much more to do. Right now.""

<html><body><p>Betty White, the Emmy-winning star of ""The Golden Girls"" and ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" whose career and celebrity extended into old age, died Dec. 31, 2021. She was just weeks away from turning 100.</p>
<p>White’s death inspired countless tributes. But on social media, it also prompted a familiar anti-vaccine narrative that falsely linked her death and the COVID-19 vaccines — much like the baseless rumors that took off after the deaths of baseball legend <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/26/facebook-posts/no-evidence-covid-19-vaccine-caused-hank-aarons-de/"">Hank Aaron</a>, boxer <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/mar/16/aubrey-huff/claim-blaming-covid-vaccine-hank-aaron-marvin-hagl/"">Marvin Hagler</a>, <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/apr/12/instagram-posts/fact-checking-unproven-claims-rapper-dmx-died-afte/"">rapper DMX</a> and other celebrities.</p>
<p>""‘Eat healthy and get all your vaccines. I just got boosted today,’ — Betty White, Dec 28th, 2021,"" said <a href=""https://archive.is/J12jK"">various</a> <a href=""https://archive.is/EOnIq"">Facebook</a> <a href=""https://archive.is/Cbt2n"">posts</a> shared Jan. 1 and Jan. 2.</p>

<div class=""artembed""> </div>
<p>PolitiFact and <a href=""https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/betty-white-covid-vaccine-booster/"">other fact-checkers</a> found no record of White making any such statement, and the <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-325298831235"">Associated Press reported</a> that she did not get a booster on Dec. 28.</p>

</div>]","Betty White, the Emmy-winning star of ""The Golden Girls"" and ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" whose career and celebrity extended into old age, died Dec. 31, 2021. She was just weeks away from turning 100.
White’s death inspired countless tributes. But on social media, it also prompted a familiar anti-vaccine narrative that falsely linked her death and the COVID-19 vaccines — much like the baseless rumors that took off after the deaths of baseball legend Hank Aaron, boxer Marvin Hagler, rapper DMX and other celebrities.
""‘Eat healthy and get all your vaccines. I just got boosted today,’ — Betty White, Dec 28th, 2021,"" said various Facebook posts shared Jan. 1 and Jan. 2.
The purported White quote is fabricated. 

 
PolitiFact and other fact-checkers found no record of White making any such statement, and the Associated Press reported that she did not get a booster on Dec. 28.
""Totally false statement,"" Jeff Witjas, White’s agent, said in an email to PolitiFact.
Facebook posts sharing the quote were flagged as part of the platform’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) ",PolitiFact,"

This image, shared widely on Facebook Jan. 1, featured a fake Betty White quote about the COVID-19 vaccines.
Some of the Facebook posts included a link to an article on crowrivermedia.com, a website operated by MediaNews Group, a Denver-based newspaper publisher. 
But the crowrivermedia.com article does not quote White as saying she had just received the COVID-19 booster shot. Neither does the Dec. 28 People magazine cover story about White on which the crowrivermedia.com article was based.
The cause and manner of White’s death had not been made public as of Jan. 3. Witjas previously told People she ""died peacefully in her sleep at her home early this morning.""
Unsupported and false claims blaming the COVID-19 vaccines have routinely cropped up in the wake of celebrity deaths, even though the vaccines have proven to be safe.
""You can get a COVID vaccine and still die from something else,"" Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, previously told PolitiFact.

<p>The smash-hit Broadway musical ""Hamilton"" is making its move to the TV screen, bringing Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hip-hop biography of Alexander Hamilton to a new audience.</p>
<p>The tale of the ""$10 Founding Father without a father"" has inspired years of sell-out crowds at theaters across the country. The show, which Miranda famously began writing after reading Ron Chernow’s biography, chronicles Hamilton’s ascension to the forefront of American history.</p>
<p>The show is startlingly faithful to Hamilton’s life. It draws heavily — and sometimes <a href=""https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-26-02-0001-0248"">verbatim</a> — from his <a href=""https://founders.archives.gov/index.xqy?q=Project%3A%22Hamilton+Papers%22&amp;s=1511211111&amp;r=1"">writings</a>. But some events are transposed in time, some characters take on roles played by others in real life, and some details have been changed for dramatic license.</p>
<p>The biggest controversy we found among historians is a debate over whether Miranda’s ""Hamilton"" is <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/11/opinion/what-hamilton-forgets-about-alexander-hamilton.html"">too kind</a> to its protagonist. </p>
<p>Miranda has often <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/09/lin-manuel-miranda-hamilton/408019/"">described</a> his work as ""the story of America then, told by America now."" But even <a href=""https://muse.jhu.edu/issue/36348"">some scholars</a> <a href=""https://ncph.org/history-at-work/hamilton-the-musical-blacks-and-the-founding-fathers/"">who say</a> they admire Miranda’s multiracial cast — and the catchy songs they sing — <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/theater/hamilton-and-history-are-they-in-sync.html"">have</a> <a href=""https://apnews.com/db3c9d7573334b55a651d7ceba4dc66b"">weighed in on</a> <a href=""https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/issue-table-hamilton-good-history-180969192/"">whether</a> the play’s largely heroic portrayal of Hamilton is accurate.</p>
<p>At the least, the musical has got people talking about Hamilton, his legacy and the revolutionary era. That conversation is bound to continue as the Broadway hit migrates to the TV screen and becomes available on Disney+ beginning July 3.</p>
<p>""‘Hamilton’ the musical should not be taken as the last word on these topics, and certainly not as the only word,"" said Todd Estes, professor of history at Oakland University. ""But if the musical were the only perspective on the events of Hamilton's career that most people got, the version portrayed on stage is actually pretty good and could be a lot worse.""</p>
<p>Below, we’ve compiled a non-exhaustive list of inaccuracies in ""Hamilton,"" big and small. (We reached out to Miranda and Chernow but did not hear back.)</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">On race and Hamilton’s position toward slavery</div>
<p><a id=""see-figure-1-on-politifactcom""></a><iframe allow=""encrypted-media"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""80"" src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4cxvludVmQxryrnx1m9FqL"" width=""300""></iframe></p>
<p>Some historians say Miranda’s musical inflates Hamilton’s antislavery credentials, painting him as a <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/4cxvludVmQxryrnx1m9FqL"">""revolutionary manumission abolitionist""</a> when, they say, he was less progressive on the issue of slavery in real life.</p>
<p>""It is great theater and bad history,"" said David Waldstreicher, a historian at the Graduate Center at the City University of New York, who argued in one of a <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Historians-Hamilton-Blockbuster-Restaging-Americas/dp/0813590299?SubscriptionId=AKIAJRYWOFQSYZKJJZXA&amp;tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=0813590299"">collection of essays</a> on ""Hamilton"" that the musical is part of a movement that over-glorifies the Founding Fathers. </p>
<p>The musical’s Hamilton celebrates John Laurens’ dream of building ""the first Black battalion"" and says, ""We’ll never be free until we end slavery."" Hamilton’s wife, Elizabeth Schuyler, <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/7EsSVPxaYoAZjQwhspJBs2"">says</a> in the play's final song that he ""could have done so much more"" toward ending slavery had he lived longer.</p>
<p>In reality, Hamilton may not have been as ardent an abolitionist as the play makes him out to be. He was a founder of the <a href=""https://www.nyhistory.org/web/africanfreeschool/history/manumission-society.html"">New York Manumission Society</a>, an anti-slavery group, but he did not seriously propose the total abolition of slavery, said Michael Newton, a historian and author of several books on Hamilton and the founding era.</p>
<p>""The most important error is the flat-out exaggeration of abolitionism,"" Waldstreicher said. In his <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Historians-Hamilton-Blockbuster-Restaging-Americas/dp/0813590299?SubscriptionId=AKIAJRYWOFQSYZKJJZXA&amp;tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=0813590299"">essay</a>, co-authored by the University of Missouri’s Jeffrey Pasley, Waldstreicher wrote that the real-life Hamilton ""wasn’t an antislavery activist or a ‘revolutionary’ in that sense.""</p>
<p>Hamilton propped up several Federalist slaveholders as presidential candidates, Waldstreicher and Pasley wrote. Other historians <a href=""https://muse.jhu.edu/article/659842"">noted</a> that Hamilton’s father-in-law owned slaves, and that Hamilton <a href=""https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2016/9/13/12894934/hamilton-debates-history-race-politics-literature"">may have owned</a> at least two slaves himself.</p>
<p>When slavery and race do come up in the musical, they do so ""primarily to establish Hamilton’s ‘goodness’ for modern audiences,"" said Harvard University’s Annette Gordon-Reed <a href=""https://ncph.org/history-at-work/hamilton-the-musical-blacks-and-the-founding-fathers/"">in an essay</a> for the National Council on Public History.</p>
<p>Gordon-Reed, who said she loved the musical and regularly listens to its soundtrack, was responding to an <a href=""https://online.ucpress.edu/tph/article/38/1/89/90687/Review-Essay-Race-Conscious-Casting-and-the"">essay</a> in the journal The Public Historian by Lyra D. Montiero, an assistant professor of American studies and history at Rutgers University, Newark. </p>
<p>Montiero took issue with Miranda’s decision to employ a predominantly Black and Latino cast, a move that has drawn both praise and criticism. The casting, she wrote, covers up for the fact that the ""role of people of color in the Revolution itself is silenced."" </p>
<p>""Despite the proliferation of Black and brown bodies onstage, not a single enslaved or free person of color exists as a character in this play,"" she wrote. There’s one exception, she noted: a chorus member briefly assumes the role of Sally Hemings, the biracial woman born into slavery under Thomas Jefferson who is <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/us/sally-hemings-exhibit-monticello.html"">believed</a> to have had a sexual relationship with him.</p>
<p>Chernow, who described Hamilton as an ""uncompromising abolitionist"" in his biography, told the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/theater/hamilton-and-history-are-they-in-sync.html"">New York Times</a> that the casting itself effectively writes non-white people into the Founding Fathers’ story. Daveed Diggs, who plays both Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette, <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/hamilton-roles-are-this-rappers-delight-1436303922"">said</a> he ""walked out of the show with a sense of ownership over American history.""</p>
<p>Historians like Montiero have argued that the play could have also featured the ""thousands of people of color (who) participated in the war"" as soldiers, groomsmen and in other capacities. It omits the stories of Crispus Attucks, the Black man killed during the Boston Massacre, and Cato, who was born into slavery but worked as an anti-British spy alongside Hamilton’s friend Hercules Mulligan.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">On the Reynolds Pamphlet</div>

<p>Hamilton’s decision to publish an explainer detailing his affair with Maria Reynolds is a turning point in the musical — and based on a real historical event. The musical quotes directly from the actual <a href=""https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-21-02-0138-0002"">""Reynolds Pamphlet,""</a> with some language updated for clarity. </p>
<p>As in the play, the real-life Hamilton confessed to three men that he was guilty not of illegal financial speculation, but of paying hush money to <a href=""https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-10-02-0029"">James Reynolds</a>, who extorted Hamilton under threat of publicizing the affair.</p>
<p>But in reality, it wasn’t Jefferson, Aaron Burr and James Madison who confronted Hamilton. It <a href=""https://www.history.com/news/alexander-hamilton-maria-reynolds-pamphlet-affair"">was</a> House Speaker Frederick Muhlenberg, Rep. Abraham Venable of Virginia and future President James Monroe. </p>
<p>Hamilton released the tell-all ""Reynolds Pamphlet"" <a href=""https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/alexander-hamiltons-adultery-and-apology-18021947/"">years later</a>, after a <a href=""https://www.google.com/books/edition/Alexander_Hamilton/4z5eL5SGjEoC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=callender"">journalist</a> <a href=""https://www.history.com/news/alexander-hamilton-maria-reynolds-pamphlet-affair"">published</a> details of the affair and made accusations of what he, too, suspected was illegal speculation. </p>
<p>In the musical, Hamilton’s revelations prompt his wife Elizabeth Schuyler to sing about <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/4B3qvzOMzLQXLeYgPsG3KA"">burning</a> her letters in order to ""let future historians wonder how Eliza reacted when you broke her heart.""</p>
<p>Chernow didn’t explicitly connect the lack of letters from Schuyler to the Reynolds Pamphlet. He wrote in his biography that she ""apparently destroyed her own letters and tried to expunge her presence from the history books,"" but he didn't say when she got rid of them or why. </p>
<p>In <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Revolution-Lin-Manuel-Miranda/dp/1478913649"">""Hamilton: The Revolution,""</a> a book Miranda co-authored about the musical, he said he had ""enormous freedom"" with this scene because ""Eliza’s response is lost in time.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">On Thomas Jefferson and other Founding Fathers</div>
<p><img src=""https://static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/hamilton_still_02180311_657bd4eb.jpeg""/></p>
<p><em>Daveed Diggs performs as Thomas Jefferson in ""Hamilton,"" the filmed version of the Broadway musical. (Disney+)​</em></p>
<p>Jefferson is believed to have been more mild-tempered than ""Hamilton"" lets on — a <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/thomas-jefferson/"">writer</a> more than a speaker. The musical alters some events to paint him as a foil to Hamilton.</p>
<p>Between Jefferson’s return anthem <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/2W9u3whoCkQYOUbmnSrHi1"">""What Did I Miss?""</a> and Hamilton’s claim in <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/3TfKt8mPpdXfQTMfRjHzyz"">""Cabinet Battle #1""</a> that ""we almost died in a trench while you were off getting high with the French,"" the musical gives the impression that Jefferson waited out the Revolutionary War overseas.</p>
<p>Jefferson did not fight in the war as a soldier. He was <a href=""https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/thomas-jefferson"">selected</a> as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress in 1775 and helped draft the Declaration of Independence for adoption in 1776. He served as governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781. </p>
<p>It wasn’t until 1784 that Jefferson <a href=""https://www.loc.gov/collections/thomas-jefferson-papers/articles-and-essays/the-thomas-jefferson-papers-timeline-1743-to-1827/1784-to-1789/"">left for Europe</a>, where he eventually replaced Benjamin Franklin as the U.S. minister to France.</p>
<p>Jefferson didn’t step down as secretary of state ""so he (could) run for president,"" either, despite what President George Washington’s character says in <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/0Iys022UwQ8xBfxE1g4nWZ"">""One Last Time.""</a></p>
<p>In reality, he <a href=""https://www.loc.gov/resource/mtj1.019_1253_1253/?st=text"">resigned</a> in 1793, three years before the 1796 election, when he was elected vice president. </p>
<p>The musical’s reduction of Madison to a Jefferson sidekick also results in a portrayal that is ""greatly distorted,"" said Estes, the Oakland University professor.</p>
<p>""In actuality, Madison was a giant,"" Estes said. ""Madison was absolutely an equal partner with Jefferson and stood on the same level of historical significance as Hamilton and Jefferson.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">On the election of 1800</div>
<p><a id=""see-figure-3-on-politifactcom""></a><iframe allow=""encrypted-media"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""80"" src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0LpHC9mhPAQC98IjXZIrif"" width=""300""></iframe></p>
<p>The musical’s rivalry between Hamilton and Burr peaks after <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/0LpHC9mhPAQC98IjXZIrif"">the election of 1800</a>. Hamilton sways the delegates to elect Jefferson with a late, tie-breaking ""endorsement"" that lifts Jefferson over Burr ""in a landslide"" and inspires Burr to challenge Hamilton to a duel.</p>
<p>In reality, however, Jefferson did not win solely because of Hamilton, nor was it a landslide. </p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/1800-election/1800-election.html"">election of 1800</a> saw the Democratic-Republican Party <a href=""https://www.vox.com/2015/11/28/9801376/hamilton-election-of-1800-burr-jefferson"">push</a> Jefferson for president and Burr for vice president in a bid to unseat President John Adams. The voting process was different back then. Electors in the Electoral College got two votes. The recipient of the most votes would become president, and the runner-up would become vice president.</p>
<p>Jefferson and Burr received the same number of votes, resulting in a tie that sent the decision to the House of Representatives. Hamilton <a href=""https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0131#ARHN-01-25-02-0131-fn-0001"">lobbied the House Federalists</a> to back Jefferson, but he wasn’t the deciding ""vote,"" as the musical suggests.</p>
<p>""James Bayard of Delaware is the only person who had that kind of influence, and he didn't listen to Hamilton,"" wrote Nancy Isenberg, professor of history at Louisiana State University, in a <a href=""https://muse.jhu.edu/article/659842"">journal article</a> that called Miranda’s depiction of the election ""distorted beyond recognition.""</p>
<p>It also <a href=""https://muse.jhu.edu/article/659845"">wasn’t</a> the so-called ""endorsement"" that inspired the <a href=""https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/burr-slays-hamilton-in-duel"">Hamilton-Burr</a> <a href=""https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-26-02-0001-0241"">duel</a>. According to <a href=""https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-26-02-0001-0201"">the National Archives</a>, Burr challenged Hamilton after Hamilton campaigned and allegedly made <a href=""https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-26-02-0001-0203-0002"">disparaging remarks</a> against him during Burr’s run to become New York’s governor in 1804.</p>

<p><strong>Aaron Burr:</strong> ""You punched the bursar.""</p>
<p><strong>Song:</strong> <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/6dr7ekfhlbquvsVY8D7gyk"">""Aaron Burr, Sir""</a></p>
<p><strong>Fact-check:</strong> Hamilton’s character describes punching the person who ""handles the financials"" at Princeton. But in his book on the musical, Miranda said the line was a ""historical leap"" that made for a good rhyme. The real-life Hamilton had a disagreement with Princeton’s president over his desire to graduate early, according to Chernow’s biography.</p>
<p>Miranda also wrote that the dialogue between Hamilton and Burr was a ""fictional first meeting."" Other characters in the scene, including the Marquis de Lafayette, could not have met Hamilton that early. ""Lafayette was not in America when Hamilton arrived,"" Newton, the Hamilton historian, said.</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Burr:</strong> ""Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him.""</p>
<p><strong>Alexander Hamilton</strong>: ""That’s true!""</p>
<p><strong>Song:</strong> <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/2yBMVrq96wb9OHbMdBs0lF"">""A Winter’s Ball""</a></p>
<p><strong>Fact-check:</strong> The tomcat story suggests that Hamilton was a womanizer. It appears in multiple biographies, according to the <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-dance/2016/07/07/group-upset-that-hamilton-alleges-martha-washington-named-tomcat-after-him/XSoUG3OaDUtbxxu1plxbyJ/story.html"">Associated Press</a>. But the story is actually in dispute. </p>
<p>Miranda wrote in his book on the musical that it was ""most likely a tale spread by John Adams later in life,"" while Newton <a href=""http://discoveringhamilton.com/alexander-hamilton-tomcat-fully-refuted/"">traced</a> it to a satirical letter written by someone identified as Captain Smythe. </p>
<p><strong>Angelica Schuyler:</strong> ""My father has no sons so I’m the one who has to social climb for one.""</p>
<p><strong>Song:</strong> <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/3dP0pLbg9OfVwssDjp9aT0"">""Satisfied""</a></p>
<p><strong>Fact-check:</strong> Angelica Schuyler Church had <a href=""http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=uva-sc/viu00003.xml;query=;"">several</a> brothers, a fact that Miranda has since <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJEOsyCfvQ"">said</a> he ""forgot"" while writing the musical. She was also <a href=""https://dcmetrotheaterarts.com/2018/07/10/who-were-the-schuyler-sisters-fact-and-fiction-in-hamilton/"">married</a> <a href=""https://explore.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/show/church/angelica"">by the time</a> that Hamilton came into her life, although the two did exchange frequent letters.</p>
<p><strong>The company:</strong> ""It’s the 10 duel commandments.""</p>
<p><strong>Song:</strong> <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/3lXyAQ0kekAvY5LodpWmUs"">""The Ten Duel Commandments""</a></p>
<p><strong>Fact-check:</strong> An American ""code duello"" did exist, according to <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/duel-code-duello-rules-dueling/"">PBS’s American Experience</a>. But the 1777 code had more than 10 rules — it had 25. Miranda wrote in a <a href=""https://genius.com/7860689"">Genius annotation</a> that he was inspired by ""Ten Crack Commandments,"" a rap song by the Notorious B.I.G.</p>
<p>Miranda also altered other details of the duels depicted in ""Hamilton."" For example, Burr was not present during the duel between Laurens and Charles Lee, according to an <a href=""https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-01-02-0687"">account</a> by Hamilton and Maj. Evan Edwards, Lee’s second. It’s also not clear that Washington was as upset by the duel as the musical shows.</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Burr:</strong> ""Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!""</p>
<p><strong>Song:</strong> <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/7qfoq1JFKBUEIvhqOHzuqX"">""Non-Stop""</a></p>
<p><strong>Fact-check:</strong> Hamilton did <a href=""https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2018/09/17/alexander-hamilton-and-the-constitution/"">speak</a> for roughly six hours at the Constitutional Convention, and he did propose ""his <a href=""https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-04-02-0099"">own form</a> of government,"" as the musical says.</p>
<p>The missing context is that ""Hamilton famously advocated a monarchy in a speech his colleagues admired but ignored,"" Waldstreicher and Pasley wrote in their <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Historians-Hamilton-Blockbuster-Restaging-Americas/dp/0813590299?SubscriptionId=AKIAJRYWOFQSYZKJJZXA&amp;tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=0813590299"">essay</a>. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, Hamilton had a ""serious anti-democratic bent"" that was ""played down"" in the musical, Estes said. ""The immigrant trope is used to help make Hamilton more a ‘man of the people’ than he ever was historically,"" he said.</p>
<p><strong>Alexander Hamilton:</strong> ""Do you support this Constitution? … Then defend it.""</p>
<p><strong>Song:</strong> <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/7qfoq1JFKBUEIvhqOHzuqX"">""Non-Stop""</a></p>
<p><strong>Fact-check:</strong> There’s no evidence that Hamilton invited Burr to contribute to the <a href=""https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/full-text"">Federalist Papers</a>, a series of essays arguing in support of the U.S. Constitution. In Miranda’s book on the musical, he wrote that this was a ""fictional scene."" Only Madison and John Jay contributed to the effort, while Gouvernuer Morris <a href=""https://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/gouverneur-morris"">declined</a> Hamilton’s invitation to join it.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas Jefferson:</strong> ""If New York’s in debt, why should Virginia bear it? Uh! Our debts are paid, I’m afraid. Don’t tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade.""</p>
<p><strong>Song:</strong> <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/3TfKt8mPpdXfQTMfRjHzyz"">""Cabinet Battle #1""</a></p>
<p><strong>Fact-check: </strong>It’s not true that the Southern states had paid off all their post-war debts when Hamilton proposed a plan to let the federal government assume them. The <a href=""https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/1st-congress/session-2/c1s2ch34.pdf"">funding act</a> passed as part of the Compromise of 1790 authorized the assumption of $21.5 million in debts that were owed by all 13 states, including the Southern states. </p>
<p><strong>Aaron Burr:</strong> ""Adams fires Hamilton … Hamilton publishes his response.""</p>
<p><strong>Song:</strong> <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/68Ijc4fPmT3P5BN6Vrl2s2"">""The Adams Administration""</a></p>
<p><strong>Fact-check:</strong> Hamilton resigned as Treasury Secretary in 1795, before Adams became president. Adams took over <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/john-adams/"">the presidency</a> two years later, in 1797. Hamilton blasted Adams in a <a href=""https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0110-0002"">letter</a> dated Oct. 24, 1800. </p>
<p><strong>Alexander Hamilton:</strong> ""I have never agreed with Jefferson once.""</p>
<p><strong>Song:</strong> <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/0LpHC9mhPAQC98IjXZIrif"">""The Election of 1800""</a></p>
<p><strong>Fact-check:</strong> Hamilton and Jefferson agreed on some things, such as the establishment of the <a href=""https://www.westpoint.edu/about/history-of-west-point"">United States Military Academy at West Point</a>. Along with Madison, the two famously struck a deal <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/hamilton-dinner-table-bargain-june-1790/"">over dinner</a> that led to the Compromise of 1790. Jefferson and Madison agreed to let the federal government assume state debts in exchange for moving the capital to Washington, D.C. The dinner is detailed in the musical’s <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/2TK2KSrzXD6W01qjXVjNGh"">""The Room Where it Happens.""</a></p>

<p>""Jewish people are leaving the Democratic Party. We saw a lot of anti Israel policies start under the Obama Administration, and it got worsts [sic] &amp; worse. There is anti-Semitism in the Democratic Party. They don’t care about Israel or the Jewish people.’ Elizabeth Pipko, Jexodus.""</p>

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1105441310041878530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">March 12, 2019</a></blockquote>

<p>Trump’s tweet combines some comments made earlier in the day on <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/433625-trump-promotes-jexodus-after-segment-on-fox-and-friends"">Fox &amp; Friends</a> by Pipko, spokeswoman for <a href=""https://jexodus.org/the-team/"">Jexodus</a>. The new group aims to get young Jews to vote for Republicans. The Jewish vote has been a solid bloc for Democrats for decades.  </p>
<p>Trump has tried to appeal to Jewish voters, saying that the Democratic Party is ""anti-Israel"" and ""anti-Jewish"" after a <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/08/donald-trump-rips-democrats-passing-anti-hate-resolution/3102528002/"">House resolution</a> that broadly condemned hate didn’t specifically condemn Omar. <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-minnesota-rep-ilhan-omars-comments-cause-pain-and-confusion/2019/03/10/ff3f3700-41cb-11e9-9361-301ffb5bd5e6_story.html?utm_term=.8ed202f525cb"">She drew criticism for comments</a> suggesting U.S. lawmakers are influenced on Israel by money and that Jews have dual loyalties.</p>
<p>We wondered if Jewish voters are ditching the Democrats after decades of party loyalty. We found no evidence to support the claim that Jewish voters have broken their long-term loyalty to the Democratic party. But we’re not rating Trump’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter, because there isn’t 2019 polling data of Jewish voters.</p>
<p>After PolitiFact asked about Trump’s recent comments, <a href=""https://news.gallup.com/poll/247757/one-six-jews-identify-republican.aspx"">Gallup </a>said it would be at least several months for U.S. polling to be able to document whether Jews leave the party over some of its members’ views on U.S. policy toward Israel.</p>
<p>""Although Trump has waded into the controversy, he has relatively few supporters among Jewish Americans,"" Gallup wrote. ""In fact, Jewish Americans were among the least likely to approve of Trump of all religious groups in 2018, with just 26 percent approving and 71 percent disapproving.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Polls show Jews consistently vote for Democrats</div>
<p>Jews are more Democratic and liberal than the electorate as a whole, University of Florida professor Kenneth Wald wrote in his recent book <a href=""https://www.amazon.in/Foundations-American-Liberalism-Cambridge-Religion/dp/1108708854"">The Foundations of American Jewish Liberalism</a>.</p>
<p>In the November 2018 midterms, <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/07/how-religious-groups-voted-in-the-midterm-elections/"">79 percent of Jews voted for Democrats for Congress</a>, higher than 2014, but lower than 2006. Data from 2010 wasn’t available.</p>
<p>Jews have <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/how-the-faithful-voted-a-preliminary-2016-analysis/"">consistently voted Democratic for president</a> by wide margins, though the margin fluctuates.</p>
<p><img src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/aQ8mWHUgPa11fp5G4P-F5eWQJdbeyBx7A-IrhOKqE2A454Hz0_DY9WWc-k4u86wNDyd34DQdwKcyztCiBTJNPyqtdZ8IM60-fAx0beSHiu60YbSvO7S1DoQ8SJP2CCpUUY2RsiLU""/></p>
<p>Source: Pew Research Center</p>
<p>Obama won 78 percent of the Jewish vote in 2008, according to <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/how-the-faithful-voted-a-preliminary-2016-analysis/"">Pew Research</a> analysis of national exit poll data.</p>
<p>The support dropped in 2012 when Obama drew 69 percent of the Jewish vote, according to Pew.</p>
<p>But while Mitt Romney did better than other Republicans in recent cycles, <a href=""https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-voting-record-in-u-s-presidential-elections"">Ronald Reagan</a> drew a higher percentage of Jewish voters.</p>
<p>In 2016, Trump drew 24 percent of the Jewish vote, a drop from Romney. Hillary Clinton got 71 percent, slightly more than Obama in 2012.</p>
<p>Another way to look at the data is how Jews identify their party affiliation.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.people-press.org/2018/03/20/party-identification-trends-1992-2017/#religion"">Pew Research survey data</a> shows only small fluctuations. In 2008, 72 percent of Jews identified as Democrats or leaned Democrat, dropping by 1 point in 2012 and then rising to 74 percent in 2016. In 2017, Jewish Democratic identity dropped to 67 percent, at a similar level as many other non-election years since Obama. Pew didn’t ask the identity question in 2018.  </p>
<p>""The bottom line is Republicans have been trying for over 30 years to attract Jewish voters based on Israel and it hasn’t worked,"" Wald said.</p>
<p>Most Americans don’t cast votes based solely on Israel, Wald said. Also, most Jews haven’t seen any real distance between the two parties on Israel, and the Democratic Party is more closely aligned to Jewish opinions on other issues, he said.</p>
<p>Wald hadn’t seen any polling data of Jewish voters after Omar’s comments, which started in February.</p>
<p>""She said things that do worry Jews, but I think also they understand she is not a significant voice yet in the House — she is one representative who has gotten publicity,"" he said.</p>
<p>Ira Sheskin, a Jewish demographer at the University of Miami, said Orthodox Jews are the only subgroup that have become more Republican. But Orthodox Jews account for about 10 percent of the Jewish population.</p>
<p>Finally, the Jewish electorate does not have a high opinion of President Trump.</p>
<p>A 2018 American Jewish Committee <a href=""https://www.ajc.org/news/survey2018"">poll</a> found 71 percent had an unfavorable view of Trump, and 57 percent disapproved of the way he was handling U.S.-Israel relations. He also drew criticism for saying there were fine people on ""both sides"" of a protest in Charlottesville, Va., where white supremacists chanted ""Jews will not replace us.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our conclusion</div>
<p>Trump said Jewish people are leaving the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Obama’s support among Jewish voters did drop between 2008 and 2012, but Jewish support ticked up slightly for Hillary Clinton. The level of Jewish support for Democratic presidential candidates remains well over 60 percent.</p>
<p>While there are concerns among many Jews about recent statements by a Minnesota representative, there is no current evidence to suggest that Jewish voters are leaving the Democratic Party.</p>

Rauner's Chicago schools ""bailout"" claim rooted in political histrionics, not numbers

<div adbridg-ad-class=""mobileinterstitial""></div>
<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>The sequel to Illinois’ historic budget standoff is rapidly coming to a head in Springfield, with millions of schoolchildren caught in the middle of poisonous relations between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Chicago Democrats.</p>
<p>The dispute, at the center of a new special legislative session called by Rauner, holds the potential to block billions of dollars of state funding for elementary and secondary schools across Illinois just before a new school year is set to begin.</p>
<p>At issue is a catch built into the state budget that became law on July 6 over Rauner’s objections. It says that no school funding can be issued anywhere unless a separate measure containing an ""evidence based"" funding model, such as that contained in Senate Bill 1 (SB1), also becomes law that overhauls the formula for distributing general state aid to give a bigger share to districts with more low-income students.</p>
<div class=""artembed""><a id=""see-figure-1-on-politifactcom""></a><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FGovRauner%2Fvideos%2F683724155167377%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" width=""560""></iframe></div>
<p>SB1 passed the General Assembly in May with almost exclusively Democratic votes but was in parliamentary limbo until July 31 when it landed on Rauner’s desk and he mulled carrying through on a threat to use his amendatory veto power to strike tens of millions of dollars for the financially beleaguered Chicago Public Schools. (Update: The next day, August 1, <a href=""http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=10000SB0001gms&amp;GA=100&amp;SessionId=91&amp;DocTypeId=SB&amp;LegID=98844&amp;DocNum=0001&amp;GAID=14&amp;Session="" target=""_blank"">Rauner carried through on his amendatory veto threat</a>.)</p>
<p>Rauner telegraphed his action in a July 20 press release. ""As written, the bill includes a bailout of Chicago’s broken teacher pension system,"" Rauner said,arguing that the measure rewarded Chicago at the expense of suburban and Downstate districts. Democrats beg to differ.</p>
<p>As the numbers fly and <a href=""http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/Rauner-Tells-Republicans-Revolution-is-Coming-Sources-437054813.html"">hyperbole grows</a>, we decided to take a closer look at Rauner’s ""bailout"" claim.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Dysfunctional funding</div>
<p>Believe it or not, there is one thing on which Illinois politicians of all stripes have agreed for years: The state’s system for funding public schools largely through local property taxes is woefully unfair.</p>
<p>While low-income districts scramble to provide classroom basics, more affluent districts can afford to create some of the finest educational facilities and programs in the nation. A <a href=""https://edtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/FundingGaps2015_TheEducationTrust1.pdf"">2015 report by The Education Trust</a> put it starkly: In Ohio, the highest poverty districts receive 22 percent more in state and local funds per student than the lowest poverty districts; in Illinois, the poorest districts receive 20 percent less.</p>
<p>To address this inequity, Rauner last year formed the bipartisan <a href=""https://www.isbe.net/Pages/Illinois-School-Funding-Reform-Commission.aspx"">Illinois School Funding Reform Commission</a>. In February, it <a href=""https://www.isbe.net/Documents_ISFRC/FINAL_Commission_Framework_Report_2017_02_01.pdf"">issued a report </a>recommending an ""evidence-based"" formula in which financial and academic need would become the main determinant of how state education dollars are distributed. The formula should be applied so that no school district loses funding, the report also said, a goal only met with an increase in overall state school spending.</p>
<p>That led to SB1, which <a href=""http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/votehistory.asp?DocNum=1&amp;DocTypeID=SB&amp;LegID=98844&amp;GAID=14&amp;SessionID=91&amp;GA=100&amp;SpecSess="">won passage</a> with only a single Republican vote in the House and none in the Senate.</p>
<p>No school district gets less state money under the bill, but many low-income districts <a href=""http://fundingilfuture.org/sb1factsheets/"">get more</a>. With low-income students accounting for <a href=""http://cps.edu/About_CPS/At-a-glance/Pages/Stats_and_facts.aspx"">80.2 percent of its enrollment</a>, CPS is among the latter group.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">""Bailout"" basics</div>
<p>While dismissing SB1 as a Chicago ""bailout,"" Rauner hasn’t said how he wants to change it. Nor has he addressed the inconsistency in arguing that the Chicago pension system is undeserving of state help because it is ""broken"" when it is still in healthier financial shape than the state-run pension system for all other teachers in Illinois.   </p>
<p>The governor is clearly irked that SB1 includes $221 million in state funding to help CPS cover the employer share of pension contributions for Chicago teachers. The provision is designed to remedy an historical quirk in which the state subsidized the costs of teacher pensions for every school district in Illinois except Chicago.</p>
<p>Mayor Rahm Emanuel complained the arrangement meant Chicago taxpayers were double-taxed, first to pay for teacher pensions in the city and then to contribute to the cost of teacher pensions everywhere else in Illinois.</p>
<p>The Chicago based <a href=""http://ctbaonline.org/file/460/download?token=wkzjoSF9"">Center for Tax and Budget Accountability estimates</a> that in fiscal year 2016, about $230 million in individual income taxes collected in Chicago were used for suburban and downstate teacher pension payments.</p>
<p>In a <a href=""http://www.ourquadcities.com/news/web-extra-gov-bruce-rauner-full-interview/773999582?up"">July 25 interview</a> with WHBF Channel 4 in the Quad Cities, Rauner said he objected to SB 1 because it gave Chicago pension relief while also letting it keep other current funding.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>""It’s unfair to Illinois taxpayers and to our kids that they get both. They can either choose a block grant or the pension but they can’t do both,"" Rauner said.</p>
<p>School districts in Illinois get state funding through two channels. ""General"" state aid is distributed based on a formula that factors in each district’s property tax resources. They also get funding through ""mandated categoricals,"" which are per pupil grants for specific purposes including special education, transportation and free lunch programs for low income students.</p>
<p>CPS receives its categorical funding in a <a href=""https://www.isbe.net/Documents/CPS_District_299_Block_Grant.pdf#search=chicago%20block%20grant"">""block grant""</a> that is determined using a formula developed in 1995 when the district had many more students than it does today. The block grant was created to ease administrative red tape for CPS, but declining enrollment means it also has led to a windfall for city schools.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.isbe.net/Documents/CPS_District_299_Block_Grant.pdf#search=chicago%20block%20grant"">most recent report </a>from the Illinois State Board of Education showed that CPS received $478 million in categorical funding in the 2015-2016 school year but would have received only $226 million under the system imposed on other districts.  </p>
<p>Even so, Stand for Children, an education reform group that <a href=""http://illinoistimes.com/article-8899-how-stand-for-children-snuck-into-the-statehouse.html"">became active in Illinois </a>six years ago at then private citizen Rauner’s urging, sees as flawed the governor’s claim that the SB1 financing package is skewed to favor Chicago.</p>
<p>Rauner’s own reform commission recommended that any new funding formula ensure no district get less this year than last, Stand for Children points out. As for the state pension pickup, the group says SB 1 only puts CPS on equal footing with the rest of the state.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Bye-bye block grant</div>
<p>Rauner’s complaint about Chicago’s block grant constituting a bailout ignores one of the most important aspects of SB 1: After the first year  -- in which no district would receive less funding -- Chicago’s special block grant goes away. CPS is then required to abide by the same formula for calculating the size of categorical grants imposed on other districts.</p>
<p>""The main principle going into this ‘evidence-based model’ conversation that everyone acknowledged was we can’t take money from districts, we can’t pit districts against each other, we can’t create winners and losers,"" said Jessica Handy, government affairs director for Stand for Children Illinois. ""With block grant funding, you can’t say, ‘No district loses except we don’t like this thing so we’ll take it away from Chicago.’""</p>
<p>In <a href=""http://ctbaonline.org/file/462/download?token=fUCG3pig"">another analysis</a> of SB 1, the liberal-leaning Center for Tax and Budget Accountability said cutting the current block grant for CPS would undercut the very purpose of the governor’s commission.</p>
<p>""Not cutting funding CPS already receives is rational -- given that CPS’s current level of funding is some $2.1 billion less than what the evidence shows is needed to educate its students,"" a CTBA report concluded. ""The goal after all is to move all districts forward towards adequacy.""</p>
<p>Both Stand for Children and the CTBA cite another statistic to bolster their argument that SB 1 is fair: CPS educates roughly 20 percent of the state’s children and figures to be in line for roughly 20 percent of all new school funding if the bill’s evidence-based formula kicks in.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Rauner has <a href=""http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2016-06-30/new-stopgap-spending-bill-passed-signed.html"">for more than a year</a> been open to the idea of sending pension relief to CPS in exchange for other pension reforms. He <a href=""http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/votehistory.asp?DocNum=2822&amp;DocTypeID=SB&amp;LegID=96133&amp;GAID=13&amp;SessionID=88&amp;GA=99&amp;SpecSess="">vetoed a bill </a>that would have given CPS $215 million for pensions in December, not because he opposed the idea but because he said Democrats reneged on a deal that tied CPS pension relief to approval of a broader pension reform plan for all state workers.</p>
<p>Some, but not all, of Rauner’s pension wish list was included by majority Democrats in the $36 billion state budget they enacted on July 6 over the governor’s veto.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>Attempting to parse a political buzzword like ""bailout"" might be impossible if not for the clear direction provided by Rauner’s own Illinois Education Funding Reform Commission. It called for an ""evidence-based"" school funding formula but also recommended a ""hold harmless"" provision that would ensure no district received less this year than last.</p>
<p>By that dictate alone, CPS should not be in line this year for a cut in the size of its block grant.</p>
<p>What’s more, SB1 does do away with the CPS block grant starting with the 2018-19 school year, poking a major hole in Rauner’s ""bailout"" claim.</p>
<p>The bill’s Chicago pension component can’t be called a ""bailout"" or even a perk because it only gives CPS what every other school district already has. And Rauner clearly had sought previously to bargain CPS pension help for other, statewide pension reforms. He got a major one in the budget lawmakers enacted July 6.</p>
<p>Numbers are sure to fly fast and furious as Rauner and lawmakers duke this out in Springfield in the days ahead, but we find Rauner’s  generalization that SB 1 is a ""bailout"" for Chicago schools to be False.</p>

</div>]","The sequel to Illinois’ historic budget standoff is rapidly coming to a head in Springfield, with millions of schoolchildren caught in the middle of poisonous relations between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Chicago Democrats.
The dispute, at the center of a new special legislative session called by Rauner, holds the potential to block billions of dollars of state funding for elementary and secondary schools across Illinois just before a new school year is set to begin.
At issue is a catch built into the state budget that became law on July 6 over Rauner’s objections. It says that no school funding can be issued anywhere unless a separate measure containing an ""evidence based"" funding model, such as that contained in Senate Bill 1 (SB1), also becomes law that overhauls the formula for distributing general state aid to give a bigger share to districts with more low-income students.

SB1 passed the General Assembly in May with almost exclusively Democratic votes but was in parliamentary limbo until July 31 when it landed on Rauner’s desk and he mulled carrying through on a threat to use his amendatory veto power to strike tens of millions of dollars for the financially beleaguered Chicago Public Schools. (Update: The next day, August 1, Rauner carried through on his amendatory veto threat.)
Rauner telegraphed his action in a July 20 press release. ""As written, the bill includes a bailout of Chicago’s broken teacher pension system,"" Rauner said,arguing that the measure rewarded Chicago at the expense of suburban and Downstate districts. Democrats beg to differ.
As the numbers fly and hyperbole grows, we decided to take a closer look at Rauner’s ""bailout"" claim.
Dysfunctional funding
Believe it or not, there is one thing on which Illinois politicians of all stripes have agreed for years: The state’s system for funding public schools largely through local property taxes is woefully unfair.
While low-income districts scramble to provide classroom basics, more affluent districts can afford to create some of the finest educational facilities and programs in the nation. A 2015 report by The Education Trust put it starkly: In Ohio, the highest poverty districts receive 22 percent more in state and local funds per student than the lowest poverty districts; in Illinois, the poorest districts receive 20 percent less.
To address this inequity, Rauner last year formed the bipartisan Illinois School Funding Reform Commission. In February, it issued a report recommending an ""evidence-based"" formula in which financial and academic need would become the main determinant of how state education dollars are distributed. The formula should be applied so that no school district loses funding, the report also said, a goal only met with an increase in overall state school spending.
That led to SB1, which won passage with only a single Republican vote in the House and none in the Senate.
No school district gets less state money under the bill, but many low-income districts get more. With low-income students accounting for 80.2 percent of its enrollment, CPS is among the latter group.
""Bailout"" basics
While dismissing SB1 as a Chicago ""bailout,"" Rauner hasn’t said how he wants to change it. Nor has he addressed the inconsistency in arguing that the Chicago pension system is undeserving of state help because it is ""broken"" when it is still in healthier financial shape than the state-run pension system for all other teachers in Illinois.   
The governor is clearly irked that SB1 includes $221 million in state funding to help CPS cover the employer share of pension contributions for Chicago teachers. The provision is designed to remedy an historical quirk in which the state subsidized the costs of teacher pensions for every school district in Illinois except Chicago.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel complained the arrangement meant Chicago taxpayers were double-taxed, first to pay for teacher pensions in the city and then to contribute to the cost of teacher pensions everywhere else in Illinois.
The Chicago based Center for Tax and Budget Accountability estimates that in fiscal year 2016, about $230 million in individual income taxes collected in Chicago were used for suburban and downstate teacher pension payments.
In a July 25 interview with WHBF Channel 4 in the Quad Cities, Rauner said he objected to SB 1 because it gave Chicago pension relief while also letting it keep other current funding.

By Amy Sherman • May 11, 2023







""It’s unfair to Illinois taxpayers and to our kids that they get both. They can either choose a block grant or the pension but they can’t do both,"" Rauner said.
School districts in Illinois get state funding through two channels. ""General"" state aid is distributed based on a formula that factors in each district’s property tax resources. They also get funding through ""mandated categoricals,"" which are per pupil grants for specific purposes including special education, transportation and free lunch programs for low income students.
CPS receives its categorical funding in a ""block grant"" that is determined using a formula developed in 1995 when the district had many more students than it does today. The block grant was created to ease administrative red tape for CPS, but declining enrollment means it also has led to a windfall for city schools.
The most recent report from the Illinois State Board of Education showed that CPS received $478 million in categorical funding in the 2015-2016 school year but would have received only $226 million under the system imposed on other districts.  
Even so, Stand for Children, an education reform group that became active in Illinois six years ago at then private citizen Rauner’s urging, sees as flawed the governor’s claim that the SB1 financing package is skewed to favor Chicago.
Rauner’s own reform commission recommended that any new funding formula ensure no district get less this year than last, Stand for Children points out. As for the state pension pickup, the group says SB 1 only puts CPS on equal footing with the rest of the state.
Bye-bye block grant
Rauner’s complaint about Chicago’s block grant constituting a bailout ignores one of the most important aspects of SB 1: After the first year  -- in which no district would receive less funding -- Chicago’s special block grant goes away. CPS is then required to abide by the same formula for calculating the size of categorical grants imposed on other districts.
""The main principle going into this ‘evidence-based model’ conversation that everyone acknowledged was we can’t take money from districts, we can’t pit districts against each other, we can’t create winners and losers,"" said Jessica Handy, government affairs director for Stand for Children Illinois. ""With block grant funding, you can’t say, ‘No district loses except we don’t like this thing so we’ll take it away from Chicago.’""
In another analysis of SB 1, the liberal-leaning Center for Tax and Budget Accountability said cutting the current block grant for CPS would undercut the very purpose of the governor’s commission.
""Not cutting funding CPS already receives is rational -- given that CPS’s current level of funding is some $2.1 billion less than what the evidence shows is needed to educate its students,"" a CTBA report concluded. ""The goal after all is to move all districts forward towards adequacy.""
Both Stand for Children and the CTBA cite another statistic to bolster their argument that SB 1 is fair: CPS educates roughly 20 percent of the state’s children and figures to be in line for roughly 20 percent of all new school funding if the bill’s evidence-based formula kicks in.
It’s also worth noting that Rauner has for more than a year been open to the idea of sending pension relief to CPS in exchange for other pension reforms. He vetoed a bill that would have given CPS $215 million for pensions in December, not because he opposed the idea but because he said Democrats reneged on a deal that tied CPS pension relief to approval of a broader pension reform plan for all state workers.
Some, but not all, of Rauner’s pension wish list was included by majority Democrats in the $36 billion state budget they enacted on July 6 over the governor’s veto.
",PolitiFact,"
Attempting to parse a political buzzword like ""bailout"" might be impossible if not for the clear direction provided by Rauner’s own Illinois Education Funding Reform Commission. It called for an ""evidence-based"" school funding formula but also recommended a ""hold harmless"" provision that would ensure no district received less this year than last.
By that dictate alone, CPS should not be in line this year for a cut in the size of its block grant.
What’s more, SB1 does do away with the CPS block grant starting with the 2018-19 school year, poking a major hole in Rauner’s ""bailout"" claim.
The bill’s Chicago pension component can’t be called a ""bailout"" or even a perk because it only gives CPS what every other school district already has. And Rauner clearly had sought previously to bargain CPS pension help for other, statewide pension reforms. He got a major one in the budget lawmakers enacted July 6.

</div>]","A CNBC story circulating on Facebook displayed a misleading headline that claimed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the coronavirus ""survived"" in cruise ship cabins for up to 17 days. 
The headline, which has since been changed, led some Facebook users who shared the story to believe that the CDC now says the virus can survive on surfaces that long. 
The organization has made no such statement.

Is Barack Obama correct that mass killings don't happen in other countries?
</h2>
</header>
<div adbridg-ad-class=""mobileinterstitial""></div>
<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>After a gunman shot and killed <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/charleston-church-shooting-victims/"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">nine worshippers</a> in a historic African-American church in Charleston, S.C., President Barack Obama took to the White House podium the next day to ""express our deep sorrow over the senseless murders.""</p>
<p>In his June 18, 2015, remarks from the White House, Obama <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/06/18/statement-president-shooting-charleston-south-carolina"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">said</a>, ""Now is the time for mourning and for healing. But let’s be clear: At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency. And it is in our power to do something about it.""</p>
<p>A flurry of PolitiFact readers -- some of them prompted by <a href=""http://www.ijreview.com/2015/06/348197-obama-said-mass-shootings-dont-happen-in-advanced-countries-like-in-us-one-chart-proves-him-wrong/?utm_source=Facebook&amp;utm_medium=Owned&amp;utm_term=conservativedaily&amp;utm_campaign=Crime"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">articles</a> objecting to Obama’s claim -- wrote to us to ask us to check it, so we did.</p>
<p>An important point to make right off the bat is that many of the critics have pointed to the first part of Obama’s claim -- that ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries."" As we’ll explain, the critics have a point here -- mass violence, including mass shootings, happen in a wide variety of countries.</p>
<p>However, the critics have truncated the quotation, leaving off the next sentence -- that ""it doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency."" That’s also not fully correct, but it’s not quite as wrong as the first claim.</p>
<p>The White House argues that Obama's second sentence qualifies the first, and added that PunditFact rated <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/17/lisa-bloom/americans-are-20-times-likely-die-gun-violence-cit/"">Mostly True</a> the claim that ""Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries."" However, that claim refers to gun violence generally, not mass killings specifically, the topic of Obama's comment.</p>
<p>For a look at the statistics, we checked with two researchers, Jaclyn Schildkraut of the State University of New York in Oswego and H. Jaymi Elsass of Texas State University. They have been collecting and analyzing mass-shooting incidents in 11 countries, covering the period from 2000 to 2014. Aside from the United States, the countries they studied are Australia, Canada, China, England, Finland, France, Germany, Mexico, Norway and Switzerland.

<p>The chart does show that the United States has more mass shootings -- and more people cumulatively killed or injured -- than the other 10 nations combined, partly because it has a much bigger population than all but China.</p>
<p>Still, using this data, it’s easy to dispense with the first claim Obama made -- that ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries.""</p>
<p>Over the decade and a half studied, the researchers found 23 incidents of mass shootings in the other 10 countries, resulting in 200 dead and 231 wounded. In the United States over the same period, there were 133 incidents that left 487 dead and 505 wounded.</p>

<p>• On March 11, 2009, in Winnenden, Germany, a teenage gunman killed 15 people. The majority of the victims were children and teachers killed when the shooter opened fire in three classrooms in a local secondary school. The gunman shot two other people before killing himself after being cornered by the local police.</p>
<p>• On Sept. 23, 2008, in Kuahajoki, Finland, a gunman shot 10 people to death after opening fire on a classroom in the Kuahajoki School of Hospitality. After killing the students, the shooter burned the victims’ bodies.</p>
<p>In sum, then, Obama is wrong to say that ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries."" Clearly it does happen elsewhere, and not in trivial numbers. Seven of the countries saw double-digit numbers of people killed in mass shootings during that period.</p>
<p>By contrast, the second part of Obama’s claim -- that ""it doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency"" -- isn’t entirely off-base.</p>
<p>We compared mass shooting incidents across countries is to calculate the number of victims per capita -- that is, adjusted for the country’s total population size.</p>
<p>Calculating it this way shows the United States in the upper half of the list of 11 countries, ranking higher than Australia, Canada, China, England, France, Germany and Mexico.</p>
<p>Still, the U.S. doesn’t rank No. 1. At 0.15 mass shooting fatalities per 100,000 people, the U.S. had a lower rate than Norway (1.3 per 100,000), Finland (0.34 per 100,000) and Switzerland (1.7 per 100,000).</p>
<p>We’ll note that all of these countries had one or two particularly big attacks and have relatively small populations, which have pushed up their per-capita rates. In Norway, that single attack in 2011 left 67 dead by gunfire (plus additional bomb casualties). Finland had two attacks, one that killed eight and one that killed 10. And Switzerland had one incident that killed 14.</p>
<p>Still, while the United States did rank in the top one-third of the list, the fact that three other countries exceeded the United States using this method of comparison does weaken Obama’s claim that ""it doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency."" In at least three countries, the data shows, it does.</p>
<p>Elsass warned PolitiFact of a few caveats about the data. While they believe their database ""to be among the most exhaustive compilations available,"" Elsass noted that it may not include every instance of mass shootings. It also doesn’t include every example of mass killings -- just those committed by firearms, even though mass stabbings are not uncommon in such places as China. Finally, their database doesn’t include acts generally considered to be terrorism, such as the attack in Paris on the satirical magazine <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>.</p>
<p>""If these were included, we are likely to see something much different statistically as there have been a number of very high-profile terrorist attacks in Europe, some including the use of firearms, that are excluded from the current analysis,"" she said. But in all likelihood, this would only make the case against Obama’s claim stronger.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that it’s unwise to take these numbers as gospel -- but the figures from this database are clear enough to cast significant doubt on the accuracy of the specific claim Obama made.</p>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>Obama said after the church shootings in Charleston that ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency.""</p>
<p>The data shows that it clearly happens in other countries, and in at least three of them, there’s evidence that the rate of killings in mass-shooting events occurred at a higher per-capita rate than in the United States between 2000 and 2014. The only partial support for Obama’s claim is that the per-capita gun-incident fatality rate in the United States does rank in the top one-third of the list of 11 countries studied. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.</p>
<p><strong>EDITOR’S NOTE</strong>, <em>June 22, 2015: We heard from several of you regarding Obama's use of the word ""frequency,"" and that frequency could refer to the </em>incidents <em>of mass shootings, not deaths as we examined.

</div>]","After a gunman shot and killed nine worshippers in a historic African-American church in Charleston, S.C., President Barack Obama took to the White House podium the next day to ""express our deep sorrow over the senseless murders.""
In his June 18, 2015, remarks from the White House, Obama said, ""Now is the time for mourning and for healing. But let’s be clear: At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency. And it is in our power to do something about it.""
A flurry of PolitiFact readers -- some of them prompted by articles objecting to Obama’s claim -- wrote to us to ask us to check it, so we did.
An important point to make right off the bat is that many of the critics have pointed to the first part of Obama’s claim -- that ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries."" As we’ll explain, the critics have a point here -- mass violence, including mass shootings, happen in a wide variety of countries.
However, the critics have truncated the quotation, leaving off the next sentence -- that ""it doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency."" That’s also not fully correct, but it’s not quite as wrong as the first claim.
The White House argues that Obama's second sentence qualifies the first, and added that PunditFact rated Mostly True the claim that ""Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries."" However, that claim refers to gun violence generally, not mass killings specifically, the topic of Obama's comment.
For a look at the statistics, we checked with two researchers, Jaclyn Schildkraut of the State University of New York in Oswego and H. Jaymi Elsass of Texas State University. They have been collecting and analyzing mass-shooting incidents in 11 countries, covering the period from 2000 to 2014. Aside from the United States, the countries they studied are Australia, Canada, China, England, Finland, France, Germany, Mexico, Norway and Switzerland. (They also looked at less-developed countries, but we will exclude those since Obama specifically mentioned ""advanced"" countries.)
Schildkraut and Elsass shared the summary information from their database with PolitiFact. Here’s their table:

The chart does show that the United States has more mass shootings -- and more people cumulatively killed or injured -- than the other 10 nations combined, partly because it has a much bigger population than all but China.
Still, using this data, it’s easy to dispense with the first claim Obama made -- that ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries.""
Over the decade and a half studied, the researchers found 23 incidents of mass shootings in the other 10 countries, resulting in 200 dead and 231 wounded. In the United States over the same period, there were 133 incidents that left 487 dead and 505 wounded.
Here are a just a few examples of mass shootings in other countries:
• On July 22, 2011, a total of 80 people were killed in Norway when Anders Behring Breivik, a political extremist, bombed a government building in Oslo and then went on a shooting rampage on the island of Utoya, just outside the city.

But some conservative commentators say not all the money is going toward the cause.</p>
<p>In a since-deleted June 11 Facebook post (<a href=""https://archive.vn/aeXPg#selection-5751.0-5759.38"">archived here</a>), Ryan Fournier, co-founder of Students for Trump, claimed that donations to Black Lives Matter were actually being funneled to Democratic campaigns.</p>
<p>""All money donated to Black Lives Matter goes directly to ActBlue, a Democrat Super PAC that then feeds the money to Democrat candidates,"" he said. ""Congratulations, you played yourself.""</p>
<p>The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related"">partnership with Facebook</a>.) Fournier deleted the post after we reached out to him, but the <a href=""https://archive.vn/naPBr"">Twitter</a> version remained posted.</p>

<p><em>(Screenshot from Facebook)</em></p>
<p>Other conservative commentators, such as <a href=""https://archive.vn/FiGpi"">Candace Owens</a> and <a href=""https://archive.vn/9ZyQm"">the Hodgetwins</a>, <a href=""https://archive.vn/aJuMH"">Instagram posts</a> have made similar allegations. So we looked into them.</p>
<p>The post is inaccurate. ActBlue is a platform for people to contribute to Democratic campaigns and other causes like Black Lives Matter. It passes along donations to organizations that use its fundraising platform — it doesn’t pocket the money itself. </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Claim came from Instagram story</div>
<p>We reached out to Fournier for the source of his claim and haven’t heard back. His assertion appears to stem from <a href=""https://archive.vn/UtfWW"">a video</a> circulating on social media. </p>
<p>The video shows a screen recording of an Instagram story from a user in Miami. He attributed the information to <a href=""https://archive.vn/Uh6JL"">a conservative Instagram account</a> called ""Telerevela,"" which <a href=""https://archive.vn/146k7"">started posting</a> in February and publishes conspiratorial posts about the coronavirus pandemic and protests over police brutality in Spanish. Telerevela <a href=""https://archive.vn/YvUq3"">posted an identical video</a>, albeit in Spanish, on Facebook around 1 a.m. on June 11.</p>
<p>The video, which has nearly 2 million views on Twitter, lays out a false trail for Black Lives Matter donations.</p>
<p>In it, the user tries to donate to Black Lives Matter. When they tap the donate button on the movement’s website, they’re directed to a web address that has ActBlue in it. The donation page also has a disclosure about the nonprofit.</p>
<div class=""artembed""><img src=""https://static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/Screen_Shot_2020-06-12_at_4.52.00_PM.jpg""/></div>
<p><em>(Screenshot from Twitter)</em></p>
<p>Then, they open up a page from OpenSecrets.org — the website of the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics — to see how ActBlue spends its money. They highlight what appear to be several multi-million dollar contributions to Democratic presidential candidates like Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>""And that my fellow Americans is how ‘white collar’ money laundering is done,"" reads some text at the end of the video. ""BLM is just another corrupt arm of the (Democratic National Committee).""</p>
<p>The video misrepresents what ActBlue does, as well as where donations to Black Lives Matter actually go.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>Black Lives Matter is using ActBlue’s fundraising platform to <a href=""https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ms_blm_homepage_2019"">take donations</a>. But ActBlue isn’t pocketing the money.</p>
<p>ActBlue told us in an email that it passes along contributions from its fundraising platform directly to the 501(c)(3) charities or 501(c)(4) nonprofits that asked for them. Its function is similar to PayPal or Stripe, which are conduits for online purchases.</p>

<p>OpenSecrets compared ActBlue with WinRed, a fundraising platform for Republican campaigns and causes that <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2019/07/01/736990455/red-shift-how-republicans-plan-to-catch-democrats-in-online-fundraising"">was launched in 2019 to compete</a> with ActBlue. <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cmte=C00401224&amp;cycle=2020"">Both</a> <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cmte=C00694323&amp;cycle=2020"">organizations</a> facilitate fundraising for aligned political groups.</p>

<p>Democratic and Republican presidential candidates are listed as ""top vendors/recipients"" on ActBlue and WinRed’s OpenSecrets pages not because the organizations have directly donated to them, but rather because the organizations act as ""middle men"" between the donors and the candidates.</p>
<p>For example, if you were to go to <a href=""https://joebiden.com/donate-embed/"">Biden’s donation page</a>, you would be redirected to <a href=""https://secure.actblue.com/donate/joe2020?refcode=frontpage"">a page</a> on ActBlue’s fundraising platform to complete the transaction. Similarly, if you tried to donate to President Donald Trump’s <a href=""https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"">re-election campaign</a>, you’d be redirected to <a href=""https://secure.winred.com/djt/we-made-history?amount=150&amp;location=websitenav&amp;_ga=2.30044031.1725622558.1591982608-798411098.1591982608"">a page</a> from WinRed. </p>

<p>""Take the 2018 midterm elections, when Democratic House and Senate candidates outraised Republicans more than two to one in contributions from individuals,"" the center wrote. ""Republicans pointed to ActBlue, which helps donors more easily give money to Democratic candidates and liberal political groups, as a big reason why.""</p>
<p>The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc., the organization <a href=""https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblacklivesmatter.com%2Fprivacy-policy%2F"">that operates</a> the Black Lives Matter website, is fiscally sponsored by the nonprofit Thousand Currents. That means Thousand Currents <a href=""https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthousandcurrents.org%2Fblack-lives-matter%2F"">is handling</a> Black Lives Matter’s finances as the organization seeks its own tax-exempt status.

<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>A popular claim on social media asserts that donations to Black Lives Matter go directly to ActBlue, which uses them to fund Democratic campaigns.</p>
<p>It’s wrong. ActBlue is a nonprofit technology organization that provides a platform for people to contribute to Democratic campaigns and causes. Black Lives Matter and Democratic presidential candidates use the platform to fundraise.</p>
<p>ActBlue does not pocket donations that are facilitated by its platform — it routes donations to organizations in a similar way to the Republican fundraising platform WinRed.</p>
<p>The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.</p>
<p><em><strong>Correction, June 16, 2020</strong>: A previous version of this article stated that the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. is a nonprofit. In fact, it is in a fiscal sponsorship with a nonprofit. It is not yet its own 501(c)(3) organization.</em> </p></body></html>

</div>]","Since protests over the death of George Floyd erupted in late May, donations to civil rights organizations have surged. But some conservative commentators say not all the money is going toward the cause.
In a since-deleted June 11 Facebook post (archived here), Ryan Fournier, co-founder of Students for Trump, claimed that donations to Black Lives Matter were actually being funneled to Democratic campaigns.
""All money donated to Black Lives Matter goes directly to ActBlue, a Democrat Super PAC that then feeds the money to Democrat candidates,"" he said. ""Congratulations, you played yourself.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Fournier deleted the post after we reached out to him, but the Twitter version remained posted.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
Other conservative commentators, such as Candace Owens and the Hodgetwins, Instagram posts have made similar allegations. So we looked into them.
The post is inaccurate. ActBlue is a platform for people to contribute to Democratic campaigns and other causes like Black Lives Matter. It passes along donations to organizations that use its fundraising platform — it doesn’t pocket the money itself. 
Claim came from Instagram story
We reached out to Fournier for the source of his claim and haven’t heard back. His assertion appears to stem from a video circulating on social media. 
The video shows a screen recording of an Instagram story from a user in Miami. He attributed the information to a conservative Instagram account called ""Telerevela,"" which started posting in February and publishes conspiratorial posts about the coronavirus pandemic and protests over police brutality in Spanish. Telerevela posted an identical video, albeit in Spanish, on Facebook around 1 a.m. on June 11.
The video, which has nearly 2 million views on Twitter, lays out a false trail for Black Lives Matter donations.
In it, the user tries to donate to Black Lives Matter. When they tap the donate button on the movement’s website, they’re directed to a web address that has ActBlue in it. The donation page also has a disclosure about the nonprofit.

(Screenshot from Twitter)
Then, they open up a page from OpenSecrets.org — the website of the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics — to see how ActBlue spends its money. They highlight what appear to be several multi-million dollar contributions to Democratic presidential candidates like Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden.
""And that my fellow Americans is how ‘white collar’ money laundering is done,"" reads some text at the end of the video. ""BLM is just another corrupt arm of the (Democratic National Committee).""
The video misrepresents what ActBlue does, as well as where donations to Black Lives Matter actually go.

Video misrepresents ActBlue platform
Black Lives Matter is using ActBlue’s fundraising platform to take donations. But ActBlue isn’t pocketing the money.
ActBlue told us in an email that it passes along contributions from its fundraising platform directly to the 501(c)(3) charities or 501(c)(4) nonprofits that asked for them. Its function is similar to PayPal or Stripe, which are conduits for online purchases.
OpenSecrets also clarified that point in a tweeted response to Candace Owens’ post, saying that ""a donation to BLM through ActBlue goes just to BLM, not any other group.""
ActBlue is a fundraising platform used by Democrats &amp; progressives. Like WinRed on the right, many candidates use it to process donations but that money isn't pooled to be shared across candidates or groups. A donation to BLM through ActBlue goes just to BLM, not any other group. https://t.co/rb5sF7VbwA— OpenSecrets.org (@OpenSecretsDC) June 11, 2020 
OpenSecrets compared ActBlue with WinRed, a fundraising platform for Republican campaigns and causes that was launched in 2019 to compete with ActBlue. Both organizations facilitate fundraising for aligned political groups.
Despite being classified as political action committees by the Federal Election Commission, ActBlue and WinRed have ""non-contribution accounts,"" meaning they have separate bank accounts that ""will not be used to make contributions, whether direct, in-kind or via coordinated communications, or coordinated expenditures, to federal candidates or committees,"" according to the FEC.
Democratic and Republican presidential candidates are listed as ""top vendors/recipients"" on ActBlue and WinRed’s OpenSecrets pages not because the organizations have directly donated to them, but rather because the organizations act as ""middle men"" between the donors and the candidates.
For example, if you were to go to Biden’s donation page, you would be redirected to a page on ActBlue’s fundraising platform to complete the transaction. Similarly, if you tried to donate to President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, you’d be redirected to a page from WinRed. 
RELATED: ‘Defund the police’ movement: What do activists mean by that?
As the Center for Public Integrity reported when WinRed was launched, the idea is to make it easier for political campaigns to fundraise small-dollar donations.
""Take the 2018 midterm elections, when Democratic House and Senate candidates outraised Republicans more than two to one in contributions from individuals,"" the center wrote. ""Republicans pointed to ActBlue, which helps donors more easily give money to Democratic candidates and liberal political groups, as a big reason why.""
The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc., the organization that operates the Black Lives Matter website, is fiscally sponsored by the nonprofit Thousand Currents. That means Thousand Currents is handling Black Lives Matter’s finances as the organization seeks its own tax-exempt status. The Internal Revenue Service stipulates that 501(c)(3) organizations are ""absolutely prohibited"" from making contributions to political campaigns, which would apply to Thousand Currents.
",PolitiFact,"
A popular claim on social media asserts that donations to Black Lives Matter go directly to ActBlue, which uses them to fund Democratic campaigns.
It’s wrong. ActBlue is a nonprofit technology organization that provides a platform for people to contribute to Democratic campaigns and causes. Black Lives Matter and Democratic presidential candidates use the platform to fundraise.
ActBlue does not pocket donations that are facilitated by its platform — it routes donations to organizations in a similar way to the Republican fundraising platform WinRed.
The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.
Correction, June 16, 2020: A previous version of this article stated that the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. is a nonprofit. In fact, it is in a fiscal sponsorship with a nonprofit. It is not yet its own 501(c)(3) organization.

It’s an outdated video that ignores the fact that the CDC and Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, both recommend most people wear face masks to protect against the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The video post from June 24 was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related"">partnership</a> with Facebook.)</p>

<p>The 40-second clip starts off with Fauci saying, ""Right now, people should not be walking, there’s no reason to be walking around with a mask.""

<p>In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/01/facebook-posts/fight-COVID-CDC-now-says-wear-masks-in-public/"">shifted its recommendations on face coverings</a> for people over 2 years old when leaving their household. While the CDC previously discouraged people who weren’t showing symptoms from wearing face coverings, the agency said the switch came after studies about virus transmission by people who are asymptomatic.</p>
<p>In a June <a href=""https://www.thestreet.com/video/dr-fauci-masks-changing-directive-coronavirus"">interview</a> with TheStreet, a financial news website, Fauci said that wearing a mask is better than not wearing one because it can prevent a person from infecting someone else through droplets from coughing, sneezing or talking loudly, for example. Fauci also said that masks can protect, ""to a certain degree,"" the person wearing a mask from getting <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/01/viral-image/social-media-image-about-mask-efficacy-right-senti/"">infected</a>.</p>
<p>Fauci said that public health officials previously stated that face coverings weren’t necessary because they were concerned about a shortage for those who need them most, like medical professionals.</p>
<p>""Right now, unequivocally, the recommendation is when you’re out there, particularly if you’re in a situation where there’s active infection, keep the distance physically and wear a mask,"" he said on TheStreet.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>A viral Facebook post shows Fauci saying people did not need to be wearing face masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It is framed by text that says, ""Dr. Fauci: No reason to be wearing a mask.""</p>
<p>The undated clip lacks significant context. The interview happened in March, amid shortfalls of face masks for hospital workers. The CDC and Fauci have since shifted their recommendations on face masks amid rising coronavirus cases, saying that most people should wear face coverings in public spaces to reduce the spread of the virus. </p>
<p>The all-caps summary text is an oversimplification of what Fauci said. He was speaking generally when he said people did not need to be wearing a mask in public in March. However, Fauci said in the same interview that infected people should wear a mask to prevent other people from catching the virus. The clip leaves that out.</p>

<html><body><p>U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson has raised eyebrows more than once during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/analysis/2020/03/18/coronavirus-sen-ron-johnson-says-keep-outbreak-perspective/5074145002/"">Earlier this year</a>, he noted most people survive COVID-19 and argued governments shouldn’t shut down economies to contain the virus. The senator himself tested positive in early October and said he would <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/05/ron-johnson-vows-vote-amy-coney-barrett-even-if-he-has-covid/3626771001/"">wear a moon suit</a> if needed to vote in person to confirm Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. </p>
<p>On Oct. 21, 2020, Johnson, a Republican, made another comment that turned heads in Wisconsin, where cases of COVID-19 continue to skyrocket and overwhelm hospitals. </p>
<p>""Unfortunately, we’ve had more deaths, but generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we’ve flattened the curve,"" he said on a <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/21/ron-johnson-says-weve-flattened-curve-coronavirus/6005908002/"">call with Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp; Commerce</a>. ""We’ve gotten better at treating it.""</p>
<p>Is he right that deaths are ""pretty flat because we’ve flattened the curve""?</p>
<p>Let’s dig in. </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">COVID-19 deaths in Wisconsin</div>
<p>Johnson’s claim came as part of his legislative update for the WMC, the state’s largest business lobby. Here’s his full statement about COVID-19 deaths, which he made after WMC president and CEO Kurt Bauer asked the senator how he was feeling: </p>
<p>""I think it’s important to note, and I heard a little bit of your earlier presenter, as we’re struggling with, there’s no doubt about it, a surge in cases — we had another record day yesterday in COVID — unfortunately, we’ve had more deaths, but generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we’ve flattened the curve, we’ve gotten better at treating it, we know about the anti-inflammatories and steroids and convalescent plasma, which will hopefully be available here shortly.""</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/deaths.htm"">According to the state Department of Health Services</a>, COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wisconsin are at their highest ever. The state’s worst day came Oct. 21 — the same day Johnson made this claim — when officials reported 48 deaths, surpassing a previous record of 34 reported on Oct. 13. As of Oct. 22, 2020, the seven-day average for deaths sat at 21.</p>
<p>In the spring, by contrast, the number of deaths reported in one day peaked at 22, and the seven-day average never surpassed 13.</p>
<p>""Of course the curve has not flattened and we don't have the virus under control,"" Patrick Remington, a former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiologist and director of the preventive medicine residency program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/wisconsin/2020/10/21/wisconsin-coronavirus-state-reports-4-205-new-cases-48-deaths/3717200001/"">told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Flattened the curve?</div>
<p>When asked for evidence to support the senator’s claim, spokesman Ben Voelkel said Johnson was ""talking about flattening the curve of deaths nationally — ‘generally,’ as he puts it."" Voelkel said that statement is supported by statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the New York Times. </p>
<p>But Johnson began by mentioning the recent spikes in Wisconsin and was speaking to a group of Wisconsin business leaders, leaving listeners with the impression that he meant death numbers here. He made no attempt to distinguish statewide trends from national. </p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>Johnson also revisited the point during a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/senronjohnson/posts/3960264647335700?__tn__=-R"">telephone town hall the next day</a>, saying ""we can see the light at the tunnel nationally on this.""</p>
<p>""We have a dramatic increase in cases in Wisconsin,"" he said. ""And again, the good news is, if you do look at the number of deaths, those have kicked up as well, but it’s still relatively flat. It hasn’t followed the same uptick in terms of number of cases.""</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the national data cited by Johnson’s staff. </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html"">According to the New York Times</a>, daily reported coronavirus deaths peaked in mid-April, with some days exceeding 2,700 nationwide. More recently, that number ranged from 267 deaths on Sept. 27 to 1,208 on Oct. 21. However, the more telling seven-day average largely stayed in the 700s over the past month.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm"">which tracks deaths weekly</a>, pointed to similar trends: a peak in mid-April followed by a slight increase around August and a decline since early September. </p>
<p>So, from that perspective, Johnson’s claim is more on point. Deaths have decreased overall since the pandemic’s onset, and seven-day averages reported by the New York Times remained steady in recent weeks even as daily numbers fluctuated. </p>
<p>There is a problem here, though. Johnson attributes the ""pretty flat"" deaths in part to a flattening of the curve, which typically refers to the number of cases. And the United States clearly has not flattened the curve. </p>
<p><a href=""https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases"">As Johns Hopkins University</a> has noted, flattening the curve ""involves reducing the number of new COVID-19 cases from one day to the next"" to help prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. </p>
<p>Data from the university show the United States is doing the opposite — the seven-day average has risen steadily since September. </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>On a call with Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp; Commerce, Johnson said, ""Generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we've flattened the curve.""</p>
<p>Cases are up nationwide and in Wisconsin, so the curve of new cases has not been flattened. And deaths in Wisconsin are at an all-time high, even if nationally they have been more stable. </p>
<p>A Johnson spokesman argued the senator was referring to national trends when he spoke. However, he made the claim in the context of discussing the situation in Wisconsin, and even if one were to use a national perspective, he’s only partially correct.</p>
<p>A statement is Mostly False when it contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.</p>

</div>]","U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson has raised eyebrows more than once during the coronavirus pandemic.
Earlier this year, he noted most people survive COVID-19 and argued governments shouldn’t shut down economies to contain the virus. The senator himself tested positive in early October and said he would wear a moon suit if needed to vote in person to confirm Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
On Oct. 21, 2020, Johnson, a Republican, made another comment that turned heads in Wisconsin, where cases of COVID-19 continue to skyrocket and overwhelm hospitals. 
""Unfortunately, we’ve had more deaths, but generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we’ve flattened the curve,"" he said on a call with Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp; Commerce. ""We’ve gotten better at treating it.""
Is he right that deaths are ""pretty flat because we’ve flattened the curve""?
Let’s dig in. 
COVID-19 deaths in Wisconsin
Johnson’s claim came as part of his legislative update for the WMC, the state’s largest business lobby. Here’s his full statement about COVID-19 deaths, which he made after WMC president and CEO Kurt Bauer asked the senator how he was feeling: 
""I think it’s important to note, and I heard a little bit of your earlier presenter, as we’re struggling with, there’s no doubt about it, a surge in cases — we had another record day yesterday in COVID — unfortunately, we’ve had more deaths, but generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we’ve flattened the curve, we’ve gotten better at treating it, we know about the anti-inflammatories and steroids and convalescent plasma, which will hopefully be available here shortly.""
According to the state Department of Health Services, COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wisconsin are at their highest ever. The state’s worst day came Oct. 21 — the same day Johnson made this claim — when officials reported 48 deaths, surpassing a previous record of 34 reported on Oct. 13. As of Oct. 22, 2020, the seven-day average for deaths sat at 21.
In the spring, by contrast, the number of deaths reported in one day peaked at 22, and the seven-day average never surpassed 13.
""Of course the curve has not flattened and we don't have the virus under control,"" Patrick Remington, a former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiologist and director of the preventive medicine residency program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
Flattened the curve?
When asked for evidence to support the senator’s claim, spokesman Ben Voelkel said Johnson was ""talking about flattening the curve of deaths nationally — ‘generally,’ as he puts it."" Voelkel said that statement is supported by statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the New York Times. 
But Johnson began by mentioning the recent spikes in Wisconsin and was speaking to a group of Wisconsin business leaders, leaving listeners with the impression that he meant death numbers here. He made no attempt to distinguish statewide trends from national.

Johnson also revisited the point during a telephone town hall the next day, saying ""we can see the light at the tunnel nationally on this.""
""We have a dramatic increase in cases in Wisconsin,"" he said. ""And again, the good news is, if you do look at the number of deaths, those have kicked up as well, but it’s still relatively flat. It hasn’t followed the same uptick in terms of number of cases.""

More recently, that number ranged from 267 deaths on Sept. 27 to 1,208 on Oct. 21. However, the more telling seven-day average largely stayed in the 700s over the past month.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks deaths weekly, pointed to similar trends: a peak in mid-April followed by a slight increase around August and a decline since early September. 
So, from that perspective, Johnson’s claim is more on point. Deaths have decreased overall since the pandemic’s onset, and seven-day averages reported by the New York Times remained steady in recent weeks even as daily numbers fluctuated. 
There is a problem here, though. Johnson attributes the ""pretty flat"" deaths in part to a flattening of the curve, which typically refers to the number of cases. And the United States clearly has not flattened the curve. 
As Johns Hopkins University has noted, flattening the curve ""involves reducing the number of new COVID-19 cases from one day to the next"" to help prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. 
Data from the university show the United States is doing the opposite — the seven-day average has risen steadily since September.

<p>Plexiglass partitions didn’t stop the vice presidential candidates from clashing over the coronavirus, taxes, China, health care, and climate change.</p>
<p>In a civil but pointed 90-minute exchange, Democrat Sen. Kamala Harris exaggerated the failings of the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic and the economy. Vice President Mike Pence repeatedly used the phrase ""the reality is ..."" to introduce claims that didn’t measure up. They both ignored pointed questions from moderator Susan Page in favor of deploying their own talking points. </p>

<p>Here’s a rundown of what we fact-checked from the Oct. 7 debate in Salt Lake City.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Kamala Harris: ""The president said (the coronavirus) was a hoax.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Rating: <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/15/joe-biden/ad-watch-biden-video-twists-trumps-words-coronavir/"">False</a> </strong></p>
<p>This often-repeated statement falsely attributed to President Donald Trump has its roots in a Feb. 28 rally in South Carolina. But it’s a mischaracterization of what he actually said, which was an attack on Democrats’ response to the virus.</p>
<p>Trump cast the Democrats’ criticism of his work as foisting a hoax on the public. ""They tried the impeachment hoax,"" he said. ""That was not a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.""</p>

<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Mike Pence: The Rose Garden event with Judge Amy Coney Barrett ""was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advised.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Wrong</strong></p>
<p>The event included an indoor component, during which President Trump, Barrett and others posed for photos without wearing masks. Public health officials do say outdoor activities —  where people are wearing masks and have the room to social distance — are less risky amid the pandemic than indoor events, where it might be harder to keep people apart and there’s less ventilation. But attendees of the Sept. 26 White House event for the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court <a href=""http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Supreme-Court-Trump/2024a232c61f43a6bae0ee6bc18c6d23/409/0"">did not</a> practice social distancing, and many did not wear masks throughout the event.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Pence: Trump ""suspended all travel from China. ... Joe Biden opposed that decision. He called it xenophobic and hysterical.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Misleading</strong></p>
<p>There <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/aug/27/fact-checking-night-three-2020-rnc/"">were exemptions in Trump’s travel restrictions on China.</a> On Jan. 21, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first U.S. case of the new coronavirus, a patient in Washington state who had traveled from Wuhan, China. On Jan. 31, the Trump administration announced a ban on travelers from China, but it exempted several categories of people, including U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. It went into effect Feb. 2. </p>
<p>According to the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/us/coronavirus-china-travel-restrictions.html"">New York Times</a>, about 40,000 people traveled from China to the United States in the two months after Trump announced travel restrictions, and 60% of people on direct flights from China were not U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>As for the <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/27/donald-trump/fact-checking-whether-biden-called-trump-xenophobi/"">""xenophobic"" and ""hysterical"" comment</a>, Biden has not directly said that the restrictions were xenophobic. Around the time the Trump administration announced the travel restriction, Biden said that Trump had a ""record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering."" Biden also used the phrase ""xenophobic"" in reply to a Trump tweet about limiting entry to travelers from China and in which the president described the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus."" </p>

<p><em>(AP)</em></p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Harris: Obama ""created within the White House an office that basically was responsible for monitoring pandemics. They got rid of it. There was a team of disease experts that President Obama and Vice President Biden dispatched to China to monitor what is now predictable and what might happen. They pulled them out."" </strong></div>
<p><strong>Largely accurate</strong></p>
<p>Harris described two pieces of the federal government's operation to protect against new viral threats. There was a division within the White House National Security Council. And there was a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention office in China.</p>
<p>In May 2018, the top White House official in charge of the U.S. response to pandemics left the administration. His position was not filled. Then-National Security Adviser John Bolton reorganized the White House global health team. Tom Bossert, a homeland security adviser who recommended strong defenses against disease and biological warfare, left in 2018. Neither Bossert nor the official overseeing the U.S. pandemic response, nor their teams, were replaced. Some of their responsibilities were farmed out to other corners of the administration.</p>
<p>In China, the CDC program specifically charged with spotting new infectious diseases went from having four American staff in 2017 to none by 2019.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Pence: ""(Biden’s) own chief of staff, Ron Klain, would say last year that it was pure luck, that they did ‘everything possible wrong’ (with H1N1). And we learned from that.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Needs context</strong></p>
<p>Ron Klain, Biden’s former chief of staff, spoke about H1N1 during a <a href=""https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4906375/user-clip-ron-klain-pandemic-biosecurity-policy-summit"">biosecurity conference in May 2019</a>: ""A bunch of really talented, really great people working on it, and we did every possible thing wrong. And it’s, you know, 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time. And it’s just purely a fortuity that this isn't one of the great mass casualty events in American history. It had nothing to do with us doing anything right. It just had to do with luck.""</p>
<p>Klain has since told <a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/04/joe-biden-contain-h1n1-virus-232992"">Politico</a> and <a href=""https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/trump-spins-quotes-by-about-biden/"">FactCheck.org</a> that his comments were taken out of context, and that they were specifically in reference to the Obama administration’s difficulties meeting the public demand for an H1N1 vaccine. He was not talking about Biden directly.</p>
<div class=""artembed""><img src=""https://static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/AP_20282044571180.jpg""/></div>
<p><em>(AP)</em></p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Pence: The Obama administration ""left the strategic national stockpile empty.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Rating: <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/08/donald-trump/trump-said-obama-admin-left-him-bare-stockpile-wro/"">Mostly False</a></strong></p>
<p>The Obama administration did not leave an ""empty"" national stockpile. Just months before COVID-19 cases popped up in the U.S., the former director of the stockpile described it as an $8 billion enterprise with extensive holdings of many needed items. But N95 masks, for example, had been depleted after the H1N1 outbreak in 2009.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Pence: On the nation’s COVID-19 response, ""the reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Misleading </strong></p>
<p>At first glance, the <a href=""https://joebiden.com/covid-plan/"">Biden plan</a> does track closely with some of the talking points advanced by the <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/oct/06/donald-trump-issues-politifact-guide/"">Trump</a> administration — the need to develop and distribute a vaccine, provide COVID-19 tests free, reduce costs for COVID-19 treatments and produce necessary protective equipment and ventilators. But Biden’s plan also proposes many other priorities that the Trump administration has not pursued. Biden also has, throughout the campaign, followed recommendations about mask wearing and social distancing that the Trump administration has defied — a pattern that’s being blamed for Trump’s own infection with COVID-19 and the current outbreak at the White House.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Pence: The Obama administration ""left an empty and hollow plan.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Misleading</strong></p>
<p>The Obama administration <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/14/mitch-mcconnell/evidence-counters-mcconnell-claim-obama-team-left-/"">left a ""playbook""</a> that detailed steps to take in the event of an infectious disease outbreak. The 69-page document from 2016 was a National Security Council guidebook created to assist leaders ""in coordinating a complex U.S. government response to a high-consequence emerging disease threat anywhere in the world.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Harris: ""Today they still don’t have a plan"" regarding the pandemic.</strong></div>
<p><strong>Needs context </strong></p>
<p>Biden said <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/sep/30/fact-checking-first-2020-presidential-debate-joe-b/"">the same thing</a> during the first presidential debate. The Trump administration does have a plan to distribute vaccines once they are produced. But <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/sep/16/ad-watch-joe-bidens-spanish-language-ad-says-donal/"">experts say</a> the administration has failed to produce a national testing plan or a national strategy to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The administration maintains its emphasis has been on helping the economy reopen. However, it has <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/27/mike-pence/pence-rnc-speech-praises-trumps-covid-19-seamless-/"">fallen short in executing</a> a coordinated response between the federal government and states to combat the coronavirus. More than 210,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, more than in any other country.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Pence (to Harris): ""The fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine, if a vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Needs context</strong></p>
<p>Harris said during the debate that she would not trust Trump’s word that a vaccine is effective, insisting she would instead trust an expert opinion, such as Dr. Anthony Fauci: ""I will be the first in line to take it, absolutely.""  Harris <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-usa-politics/kamala-harris-says-trump-not-credible-on-possible-covid-19-vaccine-idUSKBN25X01L"">recently suggested</a> Trump would push a vaccine before it was ready to help his electoral chances. But Harris is also voicing concerns shared by many Americans; last month <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/09/17/u-s-public-now-divided-over-whether-to-get-covid-19-vaccine/"">a Pew poll found</a> Americans are divided on whether to get a COVID-19 vaccine, with 78 percent saying they are worried it will be approved too quickly.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Harris: ""The president hasn’t been transparent in terms of health records."" </strong></div>
<p><strong>Accurate </strong></p>
<p>After Trump announced his COVID diagnosis and was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for treatment, White House Dr. Sean Conley briefed reporters on the president’s health. Conley provided selective information and declined to answer questions, such as when the president first tested positive for the disease or on the condition of his lungs. Conley said he couldn’t share this information citing HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. <a href=""https://khn.org/news/hipaa-federal-health-privacy-law-protection-president-trump/"">Experts told us</a> that HIPAA does prohibit Conley from sharing any health information that the president hasn’t authorized him to share. However, if Trump wanted his doctor to be transparent, he could waive HIPAA protections. Beyond the recent questions about Trump and COVID-19, Trump has shared less general health information <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/politics/donald-trump-physical-health/index.html"">compared with past presidents</a>. But there’s also no law that requires health information disclosures by presidents.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Pence: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ""want to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Rating: <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/25/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-claim-biden-would-immediately/"">False</a></strong></p>
<p>Biden has not called for banning fracking outright. He wants to block the federal government from <a href=""https://joebiden.com/climate/"">issuing new permits for drilling</a> on public land. Biden says that he won’t shut down existing fracking operations on public land, and that he’ll allow fracking to continue on private lands, where most of it takes place.</p>
<p>Biden appeared to say that he supports a ban on ""new fracking"" during a debate with Bernie Sanders. However, he walked back those remarks the same day and has consistently said that he doesn’t support a ban on fracking. </p>
<p>The claim that Biden and Harris want to ""abolish fossil fuels"" is based on partial quotes that reference Biden’s climate change plan, which seeks to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. In <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/KFOXTV/videos/738652599904459"">September 2019</a>, Biden told a supporter, ""I guarantee you we’re going to end fossil fuel."" He then said: ""Before 2050, God willing. No, it can’t be done by 2030. No. There is not one single person that’s argued it can be done by then. But it can be done by 2050, it may be 2045.""At another <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=861775550912117&amp;ref=watch_permalink"">town hall</a> in February 2020, Biden told a heckler in the crowd, ""We are going to get rid of fossil fuels."" Then Biden said, ""We’re going to phase out fossil fuels.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Harris: ""On day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill. He will get rid of it.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Needs context</strong></p>
<p>Harris leaves out details of <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/oct/07/ad-watch-joe-bidens-tax-plan-and-middle-class-tax-/"">Biden’s tax plan</a>. Biden does not call for a full repeal of Trump’s 2017 tax law, which <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2017/dec/19/who-wins-and-who-loses-tax-bill/"">disproportionately benefited</a> the wealthy while giving cuts to more modest earners. Biden’s plan would <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/04/donald-trump-jr/donald-trump-jr-misrepresents-joe-bidens-tax-plan/"">roll back some of the cuts</a> for corporations and people with taxable incomes over $400,000.</p>
<p>Specifically, Biden would increase the top corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, which is lower than the rate of 35% that existed before Trump’s law. Biden would also raise the top federal marginal income tax rate for individuals from 37% to the old rate of 39.6%. </p>
<p>Later in the debate, Harris clarified that Biden’s tax plan would not directly raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 per year. Independent tax analysts found that to be the case, noting that lower earners could experience small hits from the indirect effects of an increased corporate tax rate.</p>
<div class=""artembed""><img src=""https://static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/AP_20282040809677.jpg""/></div>
<p><em>(AP)</em></p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Pence: The Trump administration ""inherited the slowest economic recovery"" from the Obama-Biden administration.</strong></div>
<p><strong>Misleading</strong></p>
<p>This is a glass-half-empty, glass-half-full scenario.</p>
<p>It’s accurate to say that the recovery from the Great Recession that began in the summer of 2009 and lasted until the coronavirus hit was the weakest recovery from a recession in U.S. history. (The first seven-plus years of the recovery were on Obama’s watch, while the next three-plus years were on Trump’s watch.)</p>
<p>Annual GDP growth rates during recoveries tended to reach or exceed 5% through the presidency of Bill Clinton. Under Clinton’s successor, George W. Bush, they maxed out at about 4%. Under Obama, growth was smaller still, usually 3% or below. Overall, GDP growth rates under Obama and Trump have been similar.</p>
<p>The flip side is that the recovery that began under Obama and continued under Trump set a record for the length of a recovery in July 2019, when it hit 121 months. The recovery would continue for another half a year before the pandemic began. By contrast, going back to the 1850s, only two recoveries — those that began under Clinton and John F. Kennedy — cracked 100 months.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Harris: ""There are estimates that by the end of the term of this administration, they will have lost more jobs than almost any other presidential administration.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Rating: <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/24/joe-biden/donald-trump-worst-jobs-president-recorded-history/"">Half True</a></strong></p>
<p>As of now, Trump is looking at a loss of about 4 million jobs since he took office. That indeed would give him one of the worst records on job creation going back to President Harry Truman. But no other president has faced a pandemic that cratered the economy. And no one can know for sure if any president would have done much better. </p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, if we look at employment gains in the first three years of Trump presidency, Trump comes in fourth behind Presidents Bill Cllinton, Jimmy Carter and Lyndon Johnson.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Pence: ""Joe Biden wants to repeal all of the tariffs that President Trump put into effect to fight for American jobs and American workers.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Misleading</strong></p>
<p>Biden has not publicly committed to repealing the tariffs that Trump imposed on Chinese products. He has been <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/sep/14/explained-how-trump-and-biden-would-confront-china/"">ambiguous</a> about the tariffs in his public appearances, saying only that he’ll evaluate them once in office. </p>
<p>However, Biden has been critical of Trump’s trade war with China, calling for a more targeted confrontation with the country and saying that he would shore up allegiances to oppose it multilaterally. </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Harris: ""Because of a so-called trade war with China, America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. Farmers have experienced bankruptcy because of it.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Needs Context</strong></p>
<p>Harris is most likely referencing a 2019 <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-trade-war-has-killed-300000-jobs-194717808.html"">report</a> by the forecasting firm Moody’s Analytics, which found that Trump’s trade war with China had cut American employment by 300,000 jobs. Not all of these jobs were manufacturing jobs, although the report noted that manufacturing was one of the hardest-hit industries along with warehousing, distribution, and retail. </p>
<p>The number of farmer bankruptcies did rise during the trade war. However, farm bankruptcies have been increasing <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/02/joe-biden/trade-wars-hit-farmers-hard-biden-attack-trump-ove/"">each year since 2014</a>. Experts said the trade policy is just one factor driving the increase, along with low commodity prices and natural disasters. </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Pence: ""This administration saw 500,000 manufacturing jobs created.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Misleading</strong></p>
<p>Pence’s figure <a href=""http://politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/30/donald-trump/during-debate-donald-trump-overstates-manufacturin/"">ignores the recession</a> caused by the pandemic. Between the time Trump became president in January 2017 and March 2020 — right as the pandemic hit — the number of manufacturing jobs grew from 12.37 million to 12.81 million, an increase of about 437,000. </p>
<p>By August 2020, however, the number of manufacturing jobs had fallen to 12.13 million. This means that on Trump’s watch, the change in manufacturing jobs has actually been negative, dropping by 237,000. These jobs may come back when the coronavirus is no longer a threat and the economy recovers, but that’s not the situation we’re in now, and a full recovery is no certainty.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Harris: ""Do you know that of the 50 people who President Trump appointed to the court of appeals for lifetime appointments, not one is Black?""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Accurate</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/no-black-judges-among-trumps-appeals-court-confirmations"">Bloomberg Law</a> reported in June that none of Trump’s 53 confirmed appeals court judges are Black. One is Hispanic. Seven are Asian American.</p>
<p>PolitiFact confirmed Bloomberg Law’s reporting using <a href=""https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/search/advanced-search"">data from the Federal Judicial Center</a>, the research and education agency for the nation’s federal courts. </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Pence: ""The Green New Deal's on their campaign website."" </strong></div>
<p><strong>Needs context</strong></p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’ Green New Deal resolution does appear on the Biden-Harris campaign website in a discussion of Biden’s climate action plan. <a href=""https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/#"">Biden’s plan</a> calls the Green New Deal ""a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face."" According to his website, the plan borrows ""two basic truths"" from the Green New Deal: that the U.S. needs to be more ambitious, and that the environment and economy are connected. </p>
<p>But while the Biden plan shares some of the goals of the Green New Deal — such as net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 — it differs significantly in scope, and leaves out agenda items such as universal health care and affordable housing.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Harris: ""I served, when I first got to the Senate, on the committee that’s responsible for the environment. Did you know, this administration took the word ‘science’ off the website? And then took the phrase ‘climate change’ off the website?""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Largely accurate</strong></p>
<p>A <a href=""https://envirodatagov.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Part-3-Changing-the-Digital-Climate.pdf"">2018 study</a> by the Environmental Data &amp; Governance Initiative, a watchdog group that analyzes federal environmental data, websites, institutions and policy, tracked a year of editing of U.S. government websites and found a significant overhaul of information on climate change during the Trump administration. </p>
<p>References to climate change, greenhouse gases, renewable energy, science and more were reformatted or removed completely from several government websites, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Energy Department and the White House. For example, the website of the EPA's Office of Science and Technology Policy, which develops clean water standards, once described those standards as ""science-based."" But since Jan. 30, 2017, that reference has disappeared.’</p>
<p>On the current website for the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, the body Harris referenced, we found links to old hearings that contained references to ""climate change,"" but found no mention of the phrase, or the word ""science,"" on any other area of the site. It’s not clear whether the administration had any role in that.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Pence: Biden and Harris support abortion ""all the way up to the moment of birth.""</strong></div>
<p><strong>Misleading</strong></p>
<p>Biden and Harris have not said they support abortion up to the moment of birth. They say they support Roe vs. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized abortion while giving states the ability to regulate it after a certain point. Biden and Harris say they want to codify Roe vs. Wade into law and are against state laws that they say violate the rulings in the case. Supporting Roe vs. Wade is not the same as supporting abortion up to the moment of birth, experts say.</p>
<p>""Because Roe allows states to prohibit abortion once a fetus is viable, agreement with the case does not indicate support for abortions ‘up to the moment of birth’,"" said Darren Hutchinson, a law professor at the University of Florida Levin College of Law.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Harris: When Abraham Lincoln was faced with a Supreme Court vacancy 27 days before Election Day and his party controlled the Senate, he said the people should vote first.</strong></div>
<p><strong>Needs context</strong></p>
<p>According to Harris’ ""history lesson,"" Lincoln was up for reelection when the chief justice, Roger Taney, died on <a href=""http://library.cincymuseum.org/topics/c/files/salmonchase/chsbull-v39-n4-sal-251.pdf"">Oct. 12</a>, 1864, just 27 days before the election. She’s right about the proximity of Taney’s death to the election; it was <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/19/us/politics/supreme-court-vacancies-election-year.html"">the shortest such vacancy before an election in history</a>. And Lincoln did not seek confirmation of his nominee, Salmon P. Chase, until Dec. 6, which was after the election.</p>
<p>The Biden campaign pointed to a <a href=""https://twitter.com/BeschlossDC/status/1314025734768386049"">tweet</a> during the debate by historian Michael Beschloss. However, it’s hard to confirm that Lincoln’s motivations were as high-minded as Harris suggested in her rendering of his thinking.</p>
<p>""I don’t think there is a definite answer"" for why Lincoln waited, Stephen E Maizlish, a historian at the University of Texas-Arlington and biographer of Chase, told PolitiFact.

Fact-checking the Joe Biden, Kirsten Gillibrand spat over 1980s child care tax credit vote

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., accused former Vice President Joe Biden of espousing views against working mothers in an op-ed nearly four decades ago, when he was a U.S. senator.</p>
<p>""When the Senate was debating middle-class affordability for child care, he wrote an op-ed,"" she <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/01/transcript-night-second-democratic-debate/?utm_term=.7b76aa085294"">said</a> during the July 31 debate in Detroit. ""He voted against it, the only vote, but what he wrote (in) an op-ed was that he believed that women working outside the home would, quote, ‘create the deterioration of family.’ He also said that women who were working outside the home were, quote, ‘avoiding responsibility.’""</p>
<p>Biden pushed back against Gillibrand’s attack, saying that at the time he didn’t want to give tax breaks for child care for wealthy people.</p>
<p>Our review found that Gillibrand cherry-picked Biden’s words from 1981.</p>
<p>Biden did not literally say that working women would create the deterioration of the family or that they were avoiding responsibility. </p>
<p>The op-ed shows him criticizing the concept of both parents working if it wasn’t a financial necessity.</p>
<p>Gillibrand argues is that his words came at a time when mothers overwhelmingly had most of the child care responsibilities and were far less likely than their husbands to work outside the home. So if he was making a case that one parent should stay home if the couple could afford it, statistics from the time indicate that role would have most likely to the mother.</p>
<p>""Give me a break! Who in 1981 was going to be staying home to watch the children? It's obvious. It's typically, in most families, women,"" Gillibrand <a href=""https://twitter.com/NewDay/status/1156902362931503104"">said on CNN</a> the morning after the debate. ""Women are still primary caregivers.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">What Biden wrote and said about the child care tax credit in 1981</div>
<p>During the debate, a Gillibrand campaign spokeswoman <a href=""https://twitter.com/meredithk27/status/1156749744309440513"">tweeted</a> the 1981 op-ed by Biden, which was printed in The Daily Times of Salisbury, Md.</p>
<p>At the time, Biden was<a href=""https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1981-pt13/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1981-pt13-7-2.pdf""> the only senator </a>to vote against expanding the child care tax credit. He wasn’t against the tax credit in general, but he didn’t want it for upper income couples. He had voted for a child care tax credit a few years earlier.</p>
<p>Biden wrote the op-ed to explain his opposition, and he starts it by lamenting how people of his generation and others avoid personal responsibility for themselves and their families.</p>
<p>""That is a shame,"" he wrote. ""But a recent act of Congress puts the federal government in the position, through the tax codes, of subsidizing the deterioration of the family. That is tragic."" </p>
<p>He did not say that working women were to blame for this deterioration. His overall point was that low-income families should not have to subsidize higher income families’ day care expenses. He wrote that it was ""ridiculous"" that there were families earning $1 million or more who took the child care tax credit.</p>
<p>""But what I do not accept as legitimate is social policy that encourages a couple making $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 or more a year to evade full responsibility for their children by granting them a tax credit for day-care expenses,"" he wrote. (In 1981, $30,000 was the <a href=""http://www.in2013dollars.com/"">equivalent of</a> about $84,500 today; $50,000 would be almost $141,000.)</p>
<p>Biden also made an argument that parents should take personal responsibility for caring for their children. The Senate, he said, should not ""make it easier for people who have neither the financial necessity nor personal need to forsake their responsibility to care for their own children.""</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>A few weeks before the op-ed was published, Biden spoke about the child care tax credit on the <a href=""https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1981-pt13/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1981-pt13-7-2.pdf"">Senate floor</a>. He offered an <a href=""https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1981-pt13/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1981-pt13-7-2.pdf"">amendment</a>, unsuccessfully, that would have limited the tax credit to families that earned less than $30,000.</p>
<p>Biden said he didn’t oppose women working outside the home, praising his wife, Jill, a teacher, as an example. </p>
<p>""She is a career woman. She is very devoted to her career, and very concerned about it, and she has good reason to be, and I am proud of the fact that she has such a career,"" Biden <a href=""https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1981-pt13/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1981-pt13-7-2.pdf"">said </a> July 28, 1981, on the floor. ""But it is outrageous to make my father, who makes less than $20,000 a year, to pay a tax to see to it that I can put my child in a day care center. I think that is preposterous.""</p>
<p>Biden also said, ""I have no objection to the fact that if a mother and a father want to get together and say, ‘Hey, by the way, Joe, you take care of the child and I am going to pursue my career,’ that is fine. That is a personal decision, and I am all for it."" </p>
<p>He also framed day care as something that should be used by working couples only if they financially needed it.</p>
<p>Biden’s past statements about the tax credit gained new life days before the debate. The <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-child-care-tax-credit_n_5d39fc3be4b004b6adbcee1f"">Huffington Post </a>published comments by Biden that were reported in the <a href=""https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:etHyEPXM5R8J:https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33797190/the_indianapolis_news/+&amp;cd=16&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us"">Indianapolis News</a> around the same time. </p>
<p>It included the following quote (bold type is ours):</p>
<p>""I think it is a sad commentary on this society when we say, as a matter of social policy, that we should make it easier for people who have neither the financial necessity nor the personal need to forget <strong>their responsibility to take care of a child</strong> all day from the time the child is an infant until the time he or she gets in school. <strong>I do not care whether in a modern marriage you want the man or the woman to take that responsibility.</strong> That has to be resolved by each couple individually.""</p>
<p>Biden supported child care tax credits at other times, including years before his 1981 vote.</p>
<p>While Biden didn’t single out working mothers for the deterioration of families, his comments about couples using day care and averting responsibility to care for their children could be interpreted as a criticism of women who went to work, said University of Maryland sociologist Philip Cohen, who researches family structure.</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/ppi/2015/Chartbook-On-Women%27s-Progress.pdf"">1981</a>, slightly more than 50% of women with dependent children were in the labor force compared to around 90% percent for comparable men. Of stay-at-home parents, 94% were women, Cohen said.</p>

<p>That’s not directly what Biden said in an op-ed in 1981 when he opposed expanding the child care tax credit. Biden did not want wealthier families to get the tax credit. </p>

A few weeks before the op-ed was published, Biden spoke about the child care tax credit on the Senate floor. He offered an amendment, unsuccessfully, that would have limited the tax credit to families that earned less than $30,000.
Biden said he didn’t oppose women working outside the home, praising his wife, Jill, a teacher, as an example. 
""She is a career woman.

He also framed day care as something that should be used by working couples only if they financially needed it.
Biden’s past statements about the tax credit gained new life days before the debate. The Huffington Post published comments by Biden that were reported in the Indianapolis News around the same time. 
It included the following quote (bold type is ours):
""I think it is a sad commentary on this society when we say, as a matter of social policy, that we should make it easier for people who have neither the financial necessity nor the personal need to forget their responsibility to take care of a child all day from the time the child is an infant until the time he or she gets in school. I do not care whether in a modern marriage you want the man or the woman to take that responsibility. That has to be resolved by each couple individually.""

<p>HOPE stands for Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally and dates from 1992. It was one of the country’s earliest merit-based state aid programs. Over the years, it reached hundreds of thousands of students and provided billions of dollars in assistance.</p>
<p>Until 2011, it had two basic streams: HOPE grants defrayed costs for attending technical colleges, and HOPE scholarships covered the full-tuition, plus books and other fees, for people working on two-year associate’s and four-year bachelor’s degrees.</p>
<p>In 2011, costs were outstripping proceeds from the Georgia state lottery that funded the program. The state’s newly elected governor, Republican Nathan Deal, moved to trim the spending.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">A bipartisan bill</div>
<p>In February 2011, flanked by lawmakers including Abrams, <a href=""https://gov.georgia.gov/press-releases/2011-02-22/enduring-hope-deal-legislation-saves-nations-most-generous-benefits-future"">Deal unveiled a plan</a> for HOPE. Among its many measures, it created two tiers in the scholarship awards part of the HOPE program – one for the best students and one for good but not exceptional ones.</p>
<p>The original full-tuition HOPE scholarship was renamed the Zell Miller scholarship in honor of the former U.S. senator and governor. It significantly racheted up the eligibility requirements.</p>

<p>The original HOPE scholarship remained in name, but the bill made it less generous. Instead of full tuition, it provided support that approached 90 percent of tuition, and it no longer covered books and other costs.</p>

<p>Abrams’ communications director Priyanka Mantha told us Abrams did.</p>
<p>""The original Republican proposal sought to impose testing requirements on students who wished to receive the scholarship, in order to narrow eligibility,"" Mantha said. ""But under her leadership, the scholarship retained an eligibility tier without testing requirements because such tests would have disproportionately disqualified low-income students and students of color.""</p>
<p>There is no hard data on the discussions that took place behind closed doors, but an <em><a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwiJbAWhwPe_aGFFX3NDUGF5N2pFNnRVMUhabGQ2bUtaTmVF"">Atlanta Journal Constitution</a></em> article from that time said the test score idea was in play. The news report listed eight suggestions. One of them was ""require high school graduates to earn a minimum SAT/ACT score to be eligible.""</p>
<p>Mantha said the creation of the Zell Miller scholarship with a test score requirement was the result of Abrams’ intervention.</p>
<p>""The two tiers of the HOPE program are the crux of the compromise she achieved,"" Mantha said. ""Students who may have been eliminated from eligibility under the GOP proposal instead retained access to a version of the HOPE scholarship.""</p>
<p>Ben George, chief of staff to the Senate Minority Leader in 2011, said his boss and other Democrats were not part of the discussions and were ""caught completely off-guard"" by the deal with the governor.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">The fallout from 2011</div>
<p>As part of the 2011 bill, lawmakers raised the grade average for the HOPE grant for technical colleges from 2.0 to 3.0. According to a report from the <a href=""https://gbpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Troubling-Gaps-in-HOPE-Point-to-Need-based-Aid-Solutions.pdf"">Georgia Budget and Policy Institute</a>, a liberal-leaning study center, full-time enrollment in the state’s technical college system fell ""nearly 25 percent between 2011 and 2012.""</p>
<p>In 2013, lawmakers rolled back the hike in the grade average.</p>
<p>Other changes, however, remained in place, including pulling back the amount of HOPE grant and scholarship aid. That made it harder for lower income students to stay enrolled.</p>
<p>After the first two years, a <em><a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324481204578175631182640920"">Wall Street Journal</a> </em>analysis found that students from higher income neighborhoods went from being twice as likely to secure a full-tuition scholarship to three times as likely, compared to students from lower income neighborhoods. Georgia State University told the <em>Journal </em>that it had to drop dozens of students for not paying tuition after their scholarship aid dropped (although most of them were able to return after the school made a special plea to donors).</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>Abrams said she led the fight to prevent the use of standardized test scores as part of the HOPE program.</p>
<p>In 2011, she supported a plan to make minimum test scores part of the eligibility requirements for the full-tuition HOPE scholarship. The bill that emerged renamed the full-tuition scholarship, raised the minimum grade point average and added a minimum test score requirement.</p>
<p>The bill did not add similar requirements to the original scholarship program, but made it less generous.</p>
<p>Abrams’ statement is accurate but it leaves out important details. We rate this claim Half True.</p>

</div>]","Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has taken some heat for co-sponsoring a 2011 bill to revamp the HOPE higher education aid program. Critics of the former House minority leader say she cut a deal that hurt poor and minority students.
The Abrams campaign rejected the charge.
""Under Abrams’ leadership, Democrats fought to prevent certain cuts and make sure the bill included funding for remedial classes at technical colleges, a 1 percent low interest loan program, and prevented the use of ACT/SAT testing standards that would have harmed poor students and students of color,"" spokeswoman Caitlin Highland wrote in an email Jan. 17.
A key point of contention centers on the role of standardized test scores in the aid program. In this fact-check, we looked at whether Abrams prevented the use of ACT/SAT testing standards in setting eligibility for scholarships.
A program called HOPE
HOPE stands for Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally and dates from 1992. It was one of the country’s earliest merit-based state aid programs. Over the years, it reached hundreds of thousands of students and provided billions of dollars in assistance.
Until 2011, it had two basic streams: HOPE grants defrayed costs for attending technical colleges, and HOPE scholarships covered the full-tuition, plus books and other fees, for people working on two-year associate’s and four-year bachelor’s degrees.
In 2011, costs were outstripping proceeds from the Georgia state lottery that funded the program. The state’s newly elected governor, Republican Nathan Deal, moved to trim the spending.
A bipartisan bill
In February 2011, flanked by lawmakers including Abrams, Deal unveiled a plan for HOPE. Among its many measures, it created two tiers in the scholarship awards part of the HOPE program – one for the best students and one for good but not exceptional ones.
The original full-tuition HOPE scholarship was renamed the Zell Miller scholarship in honor of the former U.S. senator and governor. It significantly racheted up the eligibility requirements.
Aimed at high performers, the Zell Miller scholarship program was limited to students with a 3.7 grade point average and a combined score of at least 1200 for the critical reading and math sections on the SAT or a 26 ACT score.
The original HOPE scholarship remained in name, but the bill made it less generous. Instead of full tuition, it provided support that approached 90 percent of tuition, and it no longer covered books and other costs.
Unlike the Zell Miller award for elite scholars, the HOPE scholarship remained free of a standardized test score requirement. As before, students were eligible if they had at least a 3.0 grade point average.
Test scores on the table
Did Abrams actually save the HOPE scholarship program from a standardized test requirement?

Mantha said the creation of the Zell Miller scholarship with a test score requirement was the result of Abrams’ intervention.
""The two tiers of the HOPE program are the crux of the compromise she achieved,"" Mantha said. ""Students who may have been eliminated from eligibility under the GOP proposal instead retained access to a version of the HOPE scholarship.""

Other changes, however, remained in place, including pulling back the amount of HOPE grant and scholarship aid. That made it harder for lower income students to stay enrolled.

<p>This claim came from a website called TrueTrumpers.com that is not a credible news media site.

Anonymous caller warns of local police arresting you about your taxes unless you call back soon
</h2>
</header>
<div adbridg-ad-class=""mobileinterstitial""></div>
<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>A phone message from a New York area code about ""your tax filings"" ominously indicated that if the Texas recipient didn’t call back soon, jail time and legal action loomed.</p>
<p>By all indications, though, the message fielded April 10, 2018 by an Austin resident from a number with <a href=""https://www.worldatlas.com/na/us/ny/area-code-607.html"">the 607 area code</a> was a scam. Significantly, agencies say, anyone getting such a call should hang up and consider <a href=""https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/contact_report_scam.shtml"">filing a complaint</a> with an independent arm of the U.S. Treasury.</p>
<p><strong>Warning message</strong></p>
<p>We transcribed the warning, which was left as a voice mail on a cell phone with a number starting with <a href=""https://www.worldatlas.com/na/us/tx/area-code-512.html"">the 512 area code</a>. In the message, an automated voice said:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:54pt"">""We have received a notification regarding your tax filings from the headquarters which will get expired in next 24 working hours. And once it gets expired after that, you will be taken into custody by the local cops as there are more serious allegations pressed on your name at this moment. We would request you to get back to us so that we can discuss about this case before taking any legal action against you.""</p>
<p><strong>Federal agency battles criminal callers</strong></p>
<p>Next, we hunted for governmental guidance about such calls.</p>
<p>In a March 2016 <a href=""https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/press/press_tigta-2016-07.htm"">press release</a>, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration stressed that if the IRS wants a taxpayer’s attention, the first contact is generally through the U.S. mail. Also, the IRS ""will not ask for payment using a prepaid debit card, a money order or a wire transfer. The IRS also will not ask for a credit card number or your bank information over the phone,"" TIGTA said.</p>
<p>At the time, TIGTA said it had fielded reports of some 5,500 victims collectively paying about $29 million ""as a result of the scam in which criminals make unsolicited calls to taxpayers fraudulently claiming to be IRS officials and demanding that they send them cash via prepaid debit cards, money orders or wire transfers from their banks.""</p>
<p>In December 2017, TIGTA issued a <a href=""https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/press/press_tigta-2017-30.htm"">fresh release</a> stating that from October 2013 through mid-November 2017, more than 2.1 million taxpayers reported receiving phone contacts from scammers--with over 12,400 victims collectively reporting payments of more than $61.6 million due to the scam.</p>
<p>The TIGTA inspector general, <a href=""https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/about_ig.shtml"">J. Russell George</a>, said in the release that such scammers ""are only succeeding with a handful of victims. On average, between 30 and 40 new victims each week report that they paid the impersonators money. This is a vast improvement over the hundreds of new victims who were reporting last year that they paid the impersonators money.""</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>When we emailed our transcript of the April 2018 phone message to TIGTA, spokeswoman Karen Kraushaar replied by email: ""TIGTA has made many arrests in connection with this scam and has numerous investigations underway. To date, as a result of our efforts, a total of 111 individuals have been charged in federal court for their involvement in IRS impersonation scam activity.  Even so, we are still receiving reports that between 4,000 and 10,000 taxpayers are receiving calls each week, so our work is ongoing.""</p>
<p><strong>State and local agencies comment</strong></p>
<p>We also shared our transcript of the phone message with the Austin Police Department and the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, which has a consumer protection function.</p>
<p>Lisa Cortinas of the APD emailed us a 2017 APD <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/191eUCtRwG-8LLXWVoYG6c8KBRuau7RTR/view?usp=sharing"">press release</a> describing a scam in which callers purported to represent the IRS with the incoming phone number showing up as an APD number. ""These scammers are not legitimate,"" the release said.</p>
<p>Kayleigh Lovvorn of the attorney general’s office told us by email: ""This is a very common ‘IRS scam’ that usually increases at tax time across the entire country."" Lovvorn pointed out a 2017 Paxton <a href=""https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-beware-of-callers-posing-as-the-irs-in-tax-scam"">press release</a> stating: ""Scam artists tell consumers that they owe back taxes and threaten to have them arrested if they don’t provide immediate payment.""</p>
<p><strong>Advice: Hang up</strong></p>
<p>The TIGTA inspector general said in the agency’s 2016 release: ""If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS or in a new twist, the Treasury Department, and uses the threat of legal action if you do not pay immediately, that is a sign that it is not the IRS calling, and your cue to hang up.</p>
<p>""Again,"" George said then, ""do not engage with these callers. If they call you, hang up the telephone."" The APD and Paxton releases each had the same advice.</p>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>An automated phone message fielded in Austin said that unless the recipient called back about ""your tax filings,"" you ""will be taken into custody by the local cops as there are more serious allegations pressed on your name.""</p>
<p>Relevant federal, state and local agencies say there’s no legitimacy to such calls, which should be reported to authorities.</p>

We would request you to get back to us so that we can discuss about this case before taking any legal action against you.""
Federal agency battles criminal callers
Next, we hunted for governmental guidance about such calls.
In a March 2016 press release, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration stressed that if the IRS wants a taxpayer’s attention, the first contact is generally through the U.S. mail. Also, the IRS ""will not ask for payment using a prepaid debit card, a money order or a wire transfer. The IRS also will not ask for a credit card number or your bank information over the phone,"" TIGTA said.
At the time, TIGTA said it had fielded reports of some 5,500 victims collectively paying about $29 million ""as a result of the scam in which criminals make unsolicited calls to taxpayers fraudulently claiming to be IRS officials and demanding that they send them cash via prepaid debit cards, money orders or wire transfers from their banks.""
In December 2017, TIGTA issued a fresh release stating that from October 2013 through mid-November 2017, more than 2.1 million taxpayers reported receiving phone contacts from scammers--with over 12,400 victims collectively reporting payments of more than $61.6 million due to the scam.
The TIGTA inspector general, J. Russell George, said in the release that such scammers ""are only succeeding with a handful of victims. On average, between 30 and 40 new victims each week report that they paid the impersonators money. This is a vast improvement over the hundreds of new victims who were reporting last year that they paid the impersonators money.""

People are participating in “National Rape Day’” on April 24.












By Gabrielle Settles • April 24, 2023







When we emailed our transcript of the April 2018 phone message to TIGTA, spokeswoman Karen Kraushaar replied by email: ""TIGTA has made many arrests in connection with this scam and has numerous investigations underway. To date, as a result of our efforts, a total of 111 individuals have been charged in federal court for their involvement in IRS impersonation scam activity.  Even so, we are still receiving reports that between 4,000 and 10,000 taxpayers are receiving calls each week, so our work is ongoing.""
State and local agencies comment
We also shared our transcript of the phone message with the Austin Police Department and the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, which has a consumer protection function.
Lisa Cortinas of the APD emailed us a 2017 APD press release describing a scam in which callers purported to represent the IRS with the incoming phone number showing up as an APD number. ""These scammers are not legitimate,"" the release said.
Kayleigh Lovvorn of the attorney general’s office told us by email: ""This is a very common ‘IRS scam’ that usually increases at tax time across the entire country."" Lovvorn pointed out a 2017 Paxton press release stating: ""Scam artists tell consumers that they owe back taxes and threaten to have them arrested if they don’t provide immediate payment.""
Advice: Hang up
The TIGTA inspector general said in the agency’s 2016 release: ""If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS or in a new twist, the Treasury Department, and uses the threat of legal action if you do not pay immediately, that is a sign that it is not the IRS calling, and your cue to hang up.
""Again,"" George said then, ""do not engage with these callers. If they call you, hang up the telephone."" The APD and Paxton releases each had the same advice.
<strong",PolitiFact,"
An automated phone message fielded in Austin said that unless the recipient called back about ""your tax filings,"" you ""will be taken into custody by the local cops as there are more serious allegations pressed on your name.""
Relevant federal, state and local agencies say there’s no legitimacy to such calls, which should be reported to authorities.

<html><body><p>Want a free car? President Donald Trump has told his audiences that undocumented immigrants are in luck, if the Democrats have their way.</p>
<p>In an Oct. 19 rally in Mesa, Ariz., <a href=""https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-maga-rally-mesa-az-october-19-2018"">Trump said</a>, ""Democrats want to give illegal aliens free welfare, free health care, and free education. Give them a driver's license. Give them a driver's license. Next thing you know, they want to buy them a car. Then they'll say the car's not good enough, how about a Rolls-Royce?""</p>
<p>The hypothetical morphed into something more the following day at a rally in Elko, Nev. No longer was this idea simply the ""next thing"" Democrats were going to dream up — by then, the Democratic proposal he mentioned had purportedly already surfaced.</p>
<p>Referring to Democrats, <a href=""https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-maga-rally-elko-nv-october-20-2018"">Trump said</a>, ""They want to take away your Second Amendment. They want to raise your taxes. They want to open your borders — let people in, illegally. And then they want to pay for those people for health care, for education. They want to give them cars, they want to give them driver's licenses. I said last night — we did a great, great rally in Arizona last night — and I said last night, what kind of car will they supply them? Will it be a Rolls-Royce?""</p>
<p>Twelve states have indeed chosen to offer driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants, which cannot be used for federal identification purposes. According to the <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/immigration/states-offering-driver-s-licenses-to-immigrants.aspx"">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>, they are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Vermont and Washington, along with the District of Columbia. Typically, an applicant must provide certain documents to obtain one, such as a foreign birth certificate, a foreign passport, or a consular card, along with evidence of current residency in the state. (Many of these states are solidly Democratic in their leanings, though some such as Nevada and New Mexico are mixed, and Utah is solidly Republican.)</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

</div>]","Misinformation about Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris has flourished online since Joe Biden selected her as running mate. One popular theme is the false claim that Harris does not meet eligibility requirements.
Here’s a new variation on that theme: 
""Kamala Harris is not able to be VP. Because she's a felon. She lied on her application to buy a gun here in CA,"" reads a Sept. 1 post that was shared thousands of times.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
""Is this true?"" one Facebook user wrote in the post’s comments.
No, reader, it is not true. There is no evidence Harris has ever been convicted of a felony. We searched news archives and court records and found nothing of that sort. 
PolitiFact reached out to the Facebook user for evidence to support the claim, but he did not respond. The post was made private or deleted soon after.
Harris, a former California attorney general who has a reputation for having been a tough-on-crime prosecutor, has been a member of the State Bar of California since June 1990, and her law license is still active. The State Bar of California website displays Harris’ license history, including ""all changes of license status due to both non-disciplinary administrative matters and disciplinary actions."" ",PolitiFact,"
If she had been charged with a crime or convicted, the state bar would have been notified. If she had been convicted of a felony, she would have been ""placed on interim suspension pending a disciplinary hearing on the merits in State Bar Court,"" according to the state bar website. Harris has no disciplinary record and her license has not been suspended.
In 2019, a spokesperson for Harris' presidential campaign confirmed that Harris owned a handgun that she had purchased years earlier. Since at least 2012, people seeking to buy a gun in California have faced a 10-day waiting period and background check to ensure the buyer is eligible to own one under California law. A person convicted of a felony cannot buy one.
While Harris was attorney general, her office released the 2013 California Firearms Laws Summary, which explained that gun buyers are required to provide personal information to the seller and wait 10 days while a background check is completed. We find no evidence Harris violated these requirements, but we also were unable to verify where her gun was purchased.
The Harris campaign declined to comment for this fact-check.
All that said, even if Harris had been convicted of a felony at some point, this would not prevent her from becoming vice president or assuming the presidency.
The requirements are the same for people seeking to become vice president or president, according to experts: A person must be a natural-born citizen, be at least 35 years old and have lived in the U.S. for at least 14 years. 
Harris meets these requirements and is eligible to be president or vice president.

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>President Donald Trump’s pardon of controversial former sheriff Joe Arpaio led to a fake news site falsely claiming Trump also pardoned a controversial government clerk from Kentucky.</p>
<p>""BREAKING: President Trump Pardons Kim Davis,"" read the headline on an <a href=""http://ourlandofthefree.com/2017/08/remember-this-lunatic/"">Aug. 26, 2017, post on OurLandOfTheFree.com</a>. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to cut down on fake news.</p>
<p>The post appeared after Trump’s <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/25/politics/sheriff-joe-arpaio-donald-trump-pardon/index.html"">Aug. 25 pardon of Arpaio</a>, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz. Arpaio had been found guilty of criminal contempt after he continued to illegally profile Latinos against a judge’s orders. His sentencing was set for Oct. 5.</p>
<p>Davis, meanwhile, was the Rowan County, Ken., clerk who had in 2015 refused to sign marriage licenses for same-sex couples on religious grounds, in defiance of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. A federal judge <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kentucky-clerk-kim-davis-released-from-jail/"">sent her to jail for five days for contempt of court</a> for not complying with an order to issue the licenses. Her deputy clerks were eventually allowed to sign the licenses; Kentucky later took county clerks’ names off marriage licenses.</p>
<p>She had faced three lawsuits for her refusal, but the <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/03/526615385/gay-couples-lawsuit-against-kentucky-clerk-is-back-on-after-appeals-court-ruling"">suits had been dismissed</a>. The same judge who jailed her later ruled that in one case, the state of Kentucky and not Davis was responsible for <a href=""http://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article162885388.html"">paying $225,000 in legal fees</a> for the couple that brought the suit.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

</div>]","President Donald Trump’s pardon of controversial former sheriff Joe Arpaio led to a fake news site falsely claiming Trump also pardoned a controversial government clerk from Kentucky.
""BREAKING: President Trump Pardons Kim Davis,"" read the headline on an Aug. 26, 2017, post on OurLandOfTheFree.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to cut down on fake news.
The post appeared after Trump’s Aug. 25 pardon of Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz. Arpaio had been found guilty of criminal contempt after he continued to illegally profile Latinos against a judge’s orders. His sentencing was set for Oct. 5.
Davis, meanwhile, was the Rowan County, Ken., clerk who had in 2015 refused to sign marriage licenses for same-sex couples on religious grounds, in defiance of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. A federal judge sent her to jail for five days for contempt of court for not complying with an order to issue the licenses. Her deputy clerks were eventually allowed to sign the licenses; Kentucky later took county clerks’ names off marriage licenses.
She had faced three lawsuits for her refusal, but the suits had been dismissed. The same judge who jailed her later ruled that in one case, the state of Kentucky and not Davis was responsible for paying $225,000 in legal fees for the couple that brought the suit.",PolitiFact,"
So Davis can’t get a pardon, because technically she wasn’t convicted of a federal crime. But it doesn’t matter, because we know that the website that posted the story makes up all its content.
OurLandOfTheFree.com is a parody site that, like other sites that created stories we’ve debunked, attempts to fool conservatives with absurd stories.
OurLandOfTheFree.com said at the bottom of its home page that the site’s creators ""make no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it most definitely is not."" Its About Us page noted, ""All posts should be considered satirical and all images photoshopped to look like something they’re not.""
The story about Davis being pardoned by Trump is as made up as the other articles on the site.

What does the law say about children and sex reassignment surgery?
</h2>
</header>
<div adbridg-ad-class=""mobileinterstitial""></div>
<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>During an Oct. 31 press conference, leaders from conservative advocacy organizations in Texas urged Gov. Greg Abbott to call a special legislative session to elect a new House speaker. </p>
<p>Earlier that month, embattled House Speaker Dennis Bonnen announced that he would not seek re-election to his seat in the House. </p>
<p>The activists also outlined policy proposals that they want lawmakers to address during a special session, proposals they say Republican leaders failed to pursue during the regular session earlier this year.</p>
<p>Cindi Castilla, president of the Dallas Eagle Forum, said lawmakers need to take steps to limit what gender transition treatments are available to children, in light of an ongoing legal battle in Dallas over the gender identity of a 7-year-old.</p>
<p>""During our last session, our legislators decided to pass a law protecting Texans from e-cigarettes until they reach the age of 21,"" she said. ""They left children able to be sterilized and mutilated at any point in their life. This was a failing, and we need a remedy.</p>
<p>""Texas Eagle Forum asked lawmakers to carry a very common-sense bill that would protect young Texans. That bill would have protected (the child), no matter what the verdict was going to be from the courts.""</p>
<p>Before we dive into this check, it should be noted that medical or surgical treatments used by doctors for transitioning must meet the same safety requirements of other medications or surgeries. To suggest that any child might be mutilated by doctors is inaccurate.</p>
<p>""Children in Texas are already robustly protected by the Texas Family Code and medical rules of ethics,"" said Brian Klosterboer, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, in a statement. ""No one in Texas may harm a child, including parents and medical professionals."" </p>
<p>When reached via email, Castilla said that she is unaware of any state laws that ""protect children from being given treatments that can lead to sterilization and no law prohibiting surgeries that would seek to make a child appear to be a gender different than the gender they were born."" </p>
<p>""Thus far, it appears very young children have been protected from this only because of the good sense of the medical community,"" she said. ""As we see this protection waning among a small portion of the medical community we would like to make sure that the most vulnerable Texans are protected."" </p>
<p>Castilla said the bill she mentioned at the press conference would have ""protected children from these procedures,"" but the group could not find a lawmaker to carry the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Dallas custody case</strong></p>
<p>The legal battle in Dallas that Castilla mentioned in her remarks is a custody dispute between a mother and father that centers on the gender identity of their 7-year-old child. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.txhealthsteps.com/static/warehouse/1076-2011-Apr-20-n54e12w0v5j3bkke32k3/section_2.html"">Generally speaking</a>, Texas law dictates that parents have a ""duty"" to provide medical and dental care to their children and they have the ""right"" to consent to that care. </p>
<p>But pursuing gender transition treatment is an individualized process for transgender and gender non-binary people and can take many forms, according to multiple resources on gender identity and gender dysphoria.</p>
<p>People with <a href=""https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria"">gender dysphoria</a> — when a person feels a conflict between the gender they were assigned at birth and the gender with which they identify — choose to act on this in different ways. </p>
<p>This can include wearing clothes and using pronouns associated with their gender identity; changing their gender and name on legal documents; pursuing hormone treatment or surgical options available for transitioning. </p>
<p>Not every person who has gender dysphoria and is transgender will pursue medical or surgical transition treatment.</p>
<p>People can be diagnosed with gender dysphoria at any age, even as children. </p>
<p>""While some children express feelings and behaviors relating to gender dysphoria at 4 years old or younger, many may not express feelings and behaviors until puberty or much later,"" reads <a href=""https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria"">an article on the subject</a> from the American Psychiatric Association. ""For some children, when they experience puberty, they suddenly find themselves unable to identify with their own body.</p>
<p><strong>Medical treatment standards prioritize affirmation</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to caring for children who might be exhibiting signs of gender dysphoria, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the ""gender-affirmative care model"" that prioritizes validating a child’s gender identity and supporting their exploration and expression of that identity.</p>
<p>""There are absolutely no medical interventions or surgical interventions on any prepubertal child,"" said Colt Keo-Meier, a Texas-based psychologist and author who specializes in gender and sexual health. ""That is not happening.""</p>
<p>The widely accepted ""Standards of Care"" maintained by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health also emphasize this point.</p>
<p>""Before any physical interventions are considered for adolescents, extensive exploration of psychological, family, and social issues should be undertaken,"" the standards read. ""The duration of this exploration may vary considerably depending on the complexity of the situation.""</p>
<p>Once a child starts puberty, other options emerge. Keo-Meier said the most common treatment — medication to delay the onset of puberty — is fully reversible.</p>
<p>""That is literally just hitting pause,"" he said.</p>
<p>The World Professional Association for Transgender Health outline minimum criteria that must be met before a child can receive puberty-suppressing medication, including that the child has demonstrated a ""long-lasting and intense pattern of gender nonconformity or gender dysphoria"" and that it ""emerged or worsened with the onset of puberty.""</p>
<p>Other, interventions like hormone therapy (partially reversible) or surgery (irreversible) won’t be considered until a patient reaches adolescence.</p>
<p>Even then, the Standards of Care stress that certain procedures should not be performed until a patient is old enough to consent on their own (typically 16-18 years old) and others should occur only once a person has received other treatments for a specific time period.</p>
<p><strong>Our Ruling</strong></p>
<p>Castilla said state lawmakers ""left children able to be sterilized and mutilated at any point in their life"" by failing to adopt a law prohibiting minors from undergoing medical or surgical gender transitions.</p>
<p>Castilla is right that there is no law regulating transition-related treatment separately from other medically-necessary care and the same age regulations apply — minors need parental consent.</p>
<p>Widely accepted guidelines for transition care emphasize gender-affirming care and therapy as primary tools for children. More intensive options, like surgery or hormone treatment, are typically reserved for older adolescents (with parental consent) and adults.</p>

</div>]","During an Oct. 31 press conference, leaders from conservative advocacy organizations in Texas urged Gov. Greg Abbott to call a special legislative session to elect a new House speaker. 
Earlier that month, embattled House Speaker Dennis Bonnen announced that he would not seek re-election to his seat in the House. 
The activists also outlined policy proposals that they want lawmakers to address during a special session, proposals they say Republican leaders failed to pursue during the regular session earlier this year.
Cindi Castilla, president of the Dallas Eagle Forum, said lawmakers need to take steps to limit what gender transition treatments are available to children, in light of an ongoing legal battle in Dallas over the gender identity of a 7-year-old.
""During our last session, our legislators decided to pass a law protecting Texans from e-cigarettes until they reach the age of 21,"" she said. ""They left children able to be sterilized and mutilated at any point in their life. This was a failing, and we need a remedy.
""Texas Eagle Forum asked lawmakers to carry a very common-sense bill that would protect young Texans. That bill would have protected (the child), no matter what the verdict was going to be from the courts.""
Before we dive into this check, it should be noted that medical or surgical treatments used by doctors for transitioning must meet the same safety requirements of other medications or surgeries. To suggest that any child might be mutilated by doctors is inaccurate.
""Children in Texas are already robustly protected by the Texas Family Code and medical rules of ethics,"" said Brian Klosterboer, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, in a statement. ""No one in Texas may harm a child, including parents and medical professionals."" 
When reached via email, Castilla said that she is unaware of any state laws that ""protect children from being given treatments that can lead to sterilization and no law prohibiting surgeries that would seek to make a child appear to be a gender different than the gender they were born."" 
""Thus far, it appears very young children have been protected from this only because of the good sense of the medical community,"" she said. ""As we see this protection waning among a small portion of the medical community we would like to make sure that the most vulnerable Texans are protected."" 
Castilla said the bill she mentioned at the press conference would have ""protected children from these procedures,"" but the group could not find a lawmaker to carry the legislation.
Dallas custody case
The legal battle in Dallas that Castilla mentioned in her remarks is a custody dispute between a mother and father that centers on the gender identity of their 7-year-old child. 
The child’s mother says the 7-year-old is a transgender girl and wants to dress as a girl and be identified by female pronouns — a process referred to as a social transition. The child’s father disagrees and insists that the child is a boy. 
The case has spurred a national debate about children and their gender identities, with some Texas Republicans pledging to pursue legislation to prevent minors in Texas from transitioning by medical means. 
Gillian Branstetter, spokeswoman for the National Center for Transgender Equality, said an important point to consider in this case is the child’s age.
""This child is 7 years old,"" she said, noting that ""no one is talking about"" pursuing a medical or surgical transition. ""We’re talking about gender affirming parenting and letting the child explore who they are.""
Looking at the law
Under federal law, transition-related medical care is considered the same as any other medically-necessary care and carries the same requirements when it comes to minors, according to Branstetter and attorneys with ACLU of Texas.",PolitiFact,"
Generally speaking, Texas law dictates that parents have a ""duty"" to provide medical and dental care to their children and they have the ""right"" to consent to that care. 
But pursuing gender transition treatment is an individualized process for transgender and gender non-binary people and can take many forms, according to multiple resources on gender identity and gender dysphoria.

Not every person who has gender dysphoria and is transgender will pursue medical or surgical transition treatment.

<p>Taken together, the ads claimed that the legislation ""would be a huge payday for Chinese manufacturing"" and ""would fill our streets with cars made with Chinese parts.""</p>
<p>James Andrew Lewis, a senior vice president at the centrist Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the group's claim is ""playing fast and loose with words."" He is a former diplomat who directs the center’s Strategic Technologies Program.</p>
<p>""When you buy an iPhone, most of the money goes to Apple but about 6 cents on the dollar goes to Chinese companies that do assembly or make parts. So does buying an iPhone help China?"" </p>
<p>David Dollar, an expert on China’s economy at the centrist Brookings Institution, said that none of the financing in the Build Back Better Act that passed the House goes to China. It is targeted to pre-K education, child care, health care, housing and clean energy, he said.</p>
<p>The House <a href=""https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2021385"">approved</a> a version of the Build Back Better Act in November. No action has been taken in the Senate. <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/text"">The House version</a> of the bill would spend <a href=""https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57626"">$1.75 trillion</a> over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. </p>
<p>Provisions include $400 billion to fund child care and preschool, $200 billion for child tax credits and $200 billion for four weeks of paid family and medical leave.</p>
<p>Saying that the bill would be a huge payday for Chinese manufacturing ""is a wild exaggeration,"" said Derek Scissors, an expert on the Chinese economy at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

James Andrew Lewis, a senior vice president at the centrist Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the group's claim is ""playing fast and loose with words."" He is a former diplomat who directs the center’s Strategic Technologies Program.
""When you buy an iPhone, most of the money goes to Apple but about 6 cents on the dollar goes to Chinese companies that do assembly or make parts. So does buying an iPhone help China?"" 
David Dollar, an expert on China’s economy at the centrist Brookings Institution, said that none of the financing in the Build Back Better Act that passed the House goes to China. It is targeted to pre-K education, child care, health care, housing and clean energy, he said.
The House approved a version of the Build Back Better Act in November. No action has been taken in the Senate. The House version of the bill would spend $1.75 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
Provisions include $400 billion to fund child care and preschool, $200 billion for child tax credits and $200 billion for four weeks of paid family and medical leave.
Saying that the bill would be a huge payday for Chinese manufacturing ""is a wild exaggeration,"" said Derek Scissors, an expert on the Chinese economy at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.

Donald Trump


stated on April 30, 2023 in a Truth Social post








A Florida elections bill “guts everything” “instead of getting tough, and doing what the people want (same day voting, Voter ID, proof of Citizenship, paper ballots, hand count, etc.).”












By Amy Sherman • May 3, 2023







""Chinese statistical authorities put the value-added of Chinese manufacturing at $4.9 trillion last year. That is probably inflated, but $4.3 trillion is a reasonable floor,"" he said. ""Any benefits for China from Build Back Better would hardly be noticeable in comparison.""
About $555 billion in Build Back Better would fight climate change.
More cars in the U.S. made with Chinese-made parts is possible, but far from certain, Scissors said.
""If the U.S. wants to do green car production at the lowest possible cost, Chinese-subsidized parts would go into those cars,"" Scissors said. 
""Of course, since we don't yet know what Build Beck Better actually is,"" he said, noting no final legislation has been adopted, ""we could choose not to focus on cars or we could accept higher costs for the sake of not depending on China for parts.""
Stand Up To China did not respond to a phone message we left.
",PolitiFact,"
The Stand Up To China group claimed that the Build Back Better legislation ""would be a huge payday for Chinese manufacturing"" and ""would fill our streets with cars made with Chinese parts.""
Experts said there is no evidence that the bill would be a financial boon to China. Most of its spending is aimed at domestic priorities, including child care and child tax credits.
We rate the statement False.

Fact Check: Does California really have ‘90,000 unsheltered’ homeless people?

<div adbridg-ad-class=""mobileinterstitial""></div>
<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>California’s homeless crisis now ranks as one of the top concerns in the state, tied for first with jobs and the economy in a <a href=""http://www.capradio.org/articles/2019/10/04/californians-say-homelessness-now-top-concern-along-with-the-economy-according-to-new-survey/"">recent survey</a>.</p>
<p>Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, who chairs the governor’s commission on homelessness, has taken notice and promised greater urgency. </p>
<p>He recently <a href=""http://www.capradio.org/articles/2019/10/29/sacramento-mayor-calls-for-rapid-expansion-of-tiny-homes-across-california"">called for his city to spend $30 million</a> to jump-start the mass production of tiny homes, structures 500 square feet or less. </p>
<p>Steinberg said these no-frills structures could house thousands of homeless people in Sacramento and elsewhere, and help ease the state’s crisis, claiming ""90,000 Californians are unsheltered and homeless."" </p>
<p>That’s nearly the population of medium-sized cities, from Santa Barbara to Livermore to Redding. Is the state’s homeless crisis really as severe as Steinberg claimed? </p>
<p>We set out on a fact check. </p>
<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve looked at Steinberg’s statements on homelessness.</p>
<p>In July, during his push for a statewide <a href=""https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/homeless/article232781027.html"">‘right to shelter’</a> law, we <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/california/article/2019/jul/25/are-most-homeless-people-california-unsheltered-an/"">examined his claims</a> about the share of unsheltered homeless people in California compared with New York City — and on the soaring rate of homeless deaths in two major cities in the state. We found his assertions were generally correct, but needed a few clarifications. </p>
<p>To verify Steinberg’s statement about 90,000 unsheltered people, we reviewed a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development study called the <a href=""https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2018-AHAR-Part-1.pdf"">2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress</a>. Housing experts consider it the most comprehensive and current set of estimates for homeless populations nationwide. </p>
<p>Released in December last year, the report shows California had nearly 130,000 homeless people both sheltered and unsheltered, a tally from a point-in-time count conducted in January 2018. That was the most of any state, far ahead of second-place New York with about 92,000 homeless people. Of course, more people live in California than any other state. </p>
<p>Of California’s total, 89,543 were unsheltered, meaning they were not living in an emergency shelter or similar residence. Instead, they were found on the street, in a vehicle or abandoned building. </p>
<p>This matches Steinberg’s statement. </p>
<p>At nearly 69 percent, California’s share of unsheltered homeless people was the highest in the nation, the report found. Oregon had the second-highest share at about 62 percent. </p>
<p>Steinberg’s spokesperson said the mayor relied on the HUD report. </p>

<p>Chris Martin, a legislative advocate on homelessness at the nonprofit Housing California, said Steinberg used the best figure available. </p>
<p>He said a new HUD report is expected in December. </p>

<p>President Joe Biden on Aug. 24 announced his <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/biden-promise-tracker/promise/1595/forgive-student-loan-debt-public-colleges-and-univ/"">plan to forgive</a> up to $20,000 of student loan debt for eligible borrowers. The plan drew criticism from many conservative politicians and pundits.</p>
<p>Pushing back, cheerleaders of Biden’s move took to social media. They drew parallels between the student debt cancellation plan and another kind of debt forgiveness: the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness. That federal program was designed to help small businesses continue paying employees throughout the COVID-19 pandemic’s early months, and many loans from the program were forgiven.</p>
<p>Even the White House got in on the action, <a href=""https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1562916200866267138?t=2EfLyvLZsgwPpnMtcUG3eA&amp;s=19"">calling out</a> Republican lawmakers whose loans from the program were forgiven.</p>
<p>But not everyone exchanging barbs had federal loans forgiven. </p>
<p>Twitter users who alleged that Shapiro, a conservative commentator and relentless Biden critic who is based in Florida, received loan forgiveness drew their proof from screenshots of ProPublica’s Tracking Paycheck Protection Program <a href=""https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus/bailouts/"">database</a>.

</div>]","A tale of two Ben Shapiros ensnared a conservative political commentator in what initially appeared to be an example of loan-forgiveness hypocrisy.
""I have a controversial idea about paying off student loan debt,"" conservative commentator Ben Shapiro said in an Aug. 23 tweet. ""Don’t take out debt you will likely be unable to pay off, and don't ask others to pay off your debts."" 
""This you?"" replied several Twitter users, attaching screenshots that show someone named Ben Shapiro benefited from $21,000 in federal Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness.
Screenshots of these Twitter exchanges spread quickly to other platforms including Facebook.
The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

(Screenshot from Facebook.)
Although the screenshots looked damning at first glance, a case of mistaken identity was at play.
A Los Angeles-based Ben Shapiro received nearly $21,000 in Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness, but that person worked in the real estate industry, according to a ProPublica database.
Media personality Ben Shapiro lived in California until he moved to South Florida in late 2020, according to news reports. Shapiro said in a Sept. 22, 2021, episode of his show that he’d lived in Florida for a year. It appears the Shapiro who got the  loan from the program is a different person.
Loan forgiveness back-and-forth
President Joe Biden on Aug. 24 announced his plan to forgive up to $20,000 of student loan debt for eligible borrowers. The plan drew criticism from many conservative politicians and pundits.
Pushing back, cheerleaders of Biden’s move took to social media. They drew parallels between the student debt cancellation plan and another kind of debt forgiveness: the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness. That federal program was designed to help small businesses continue paying employees throughout the COVID-19 pandemic’s early months, and many loans from the program were forgiven.
Even the White House got in on the action, calling out Republican lawmakers whose loans from the program were forgiven.
But not everyone exchanging barbs had federal loans forgiven. 
Twitter users who alleged that Shapiro, a conservative commentator and relentless Biden critic who is based in Florida, received loan forgiveness drew their proof from screenshots of ProPublica’s Tracking Paycheck Protection Program database. The database can be used to search ""every company approved for federal loans,"" according to ProPublica’s website.

<p>The Democratic governor <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/2021/04/20/foxconn-state-agree-new-deal-foxconn-expecting-hire-up-1-454-compared-13-000-2017/7299257002/"">negotiated a new deal</a> with the technology giant that would create 1,454 jobs and invest $672 million by 2026. In return, the company will receive a maximum of $80 million in tax subsidies — <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2021/04/23/foxconn-could-receive-up-37-m-wisconsin-over-next-two-years/7350240002/"">up to $37 million</a> of which could be paid over the next two years. </p>
<p>The plan dramatically scales back promises of 13,000 jobs and $10 billion in investment negotiated under former Republican Gov. Scott Walker that would have cost the state nearly $3 billion. But the company’s proposed LCD manufacturing facility in Mount Pleasant never came to fruition, and the company now seems to be <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/2021/04/21/foxconns-new-deal-shows-how-project-has-changed-since-2017/7323406002/"">shifting its focus</a> to create a wider range of products on that campus. </p>
<p>Evers contends the new agreement is a better outcome for Wisconsin. </p>
<p>""We fixed that agreement and found a better deal with Foxconn that will save Wisconsin taxpayers $2.77 billion while still bringing good, family-supporting jobs to Wisconsin,"" <a href=""https://twitter.com/GovEvers/status/1384894629418606594"">he tweeted on April 21, 2021</a>.</p>
<p>We’re going to focus on that number. Does the new Foxconn deal save taxpayers $2.77 billion?</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Breaking down the numbers</div>
<p>When asked for evidence to support the governor’s claim, Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback pointed to the difference in tax credits between the new agreement and what Walker negotiated. </p>
<p>The original plan would have provided Foxconn up to $2.85 billion in tax credits compared to $80 million under the new contract. The new deal includes $60.3 million in job and capital investment credits, plus another $19.7 million in performance credits if Foxconn meets and maintains job projections.</p>
<p>If you subtract $80 million from $2.85 billion, you get the $2.77 billion Evers cited. </p>
<p>That means when the governor is talking about savings, he’s really referring to how much the state will spend on subsidies. </p>
<p>But how does that fit into the larger picture of taxpayer dollars?</p>
<p>It’s first worth noting that Wisconsin has not yet given Foxconn any money. </p>
<p>The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/2020/10/12/wedc-denies-tax-credits-foxconn-work-done-2019/5969815002/"">decided last year</a> not to award tax credits to the company for work done in 2019 after determining it didn’t hire enough people. State officials expected the company to fall short for <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2020/12/02/wisconsin-doesnt-plan-give-foxconn-tax-credits-during-next-3-years/3792968001/"">several more years</a> and therefore didn’t plan to issue any subsidies during that time.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>Still, the state had to budget assuming Foxconn would meet its goals and be eligible for the money. For example, Cudaback said the 2019-21 state budget included roughly $211 million in case the company reached its job targets in the 2021 fiscal year. </p>
<p>""That’s more than $200M that couldn’t be spent on other priorities like schools, healthcare, broadband so Wisconsinites lost out on having that money invested in those areas because it had to be budgeted for Foxconn even if they did not ultimately qualify to receive those credits,"" she said.</p>
<p>It’s part of the process for the 2021-23 budget, too. In an <a href=""https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/210423Errata.pdf"">April 23, 2021 letter</a> to chairmen of the Joint Finance Committee, Administration Secretary Joel Brennan asked that the spending plan reflect $37.4 million for Foxconn from 2021-23, based on the new deal.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Taxpayer savings?</div>
<p>Now, back to Evers’ original claim. </p>
<p>It’s clear that Foxconn affected the state’s bottom line because officials had to set aside money for tax credits should the company meet its end of the agreement. But as Cudaback noted, that money theoretically could have been spent on something else if it wasn’t already earmarked — meaning it still could’ve hit taxpayers’ pocketbooks. </p>
<p>The same is true for future savings, though none of that has been budgeted beyond the two-year spending plan in front of the Legislature.</p>
<p>""Because of the renegotiated contract, the $2.77 billion saved — or, on average, nearly $200 million per biennium — can be allocated for other purposes in the state budget rather than being earmarked for a potential Foxconn payoff,"" Cudaback said.</p>
<p>Evers’ claim also doesn’t reflect the possibility that Wisconsin may never have paid a dime in subsidies under the previous deal, based on the slow progress and shrinking Foxconn plans. So, in that respect, can one really save money that may never have been spent? That’s part of the issue when Evers and others make such claims about tax incentives.</p>
<p>On the other side, if the original deal had been fulfilled — and Foxconn met all of the investment and job goals — the state would have paid more. And if a fully-realized massive LCD facility was the result, the state would have also seen a much bigger boon in jobs and economic development in return for those incentives. </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>In a tweet, Evers said the new Foxconn deal ""will save Wisconsin taxpayers $2.77 billion.""</p>
<p>The agreement does involve $2.77 billion less in state tax credits, which means taxpayers are on the hook for significantly less money. It’s important to note that the state had not paid subsidies to the company under the previous deal and wasn’t on track to do so for several years, so it’s possible much — or even all — of that never would have been paid. </p>
<p>That said, the new contract also frees up funds that officials could funnel elsewhere. There’s no telling how this will affect future budgets, but if the state does choose to reallocate that money and spend it elsewhere, taxpayers won’t enjoy the savings Evers boasted about. </p>
<p>Our definition for Half True is a statement that’s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. </p>
<p>That fits here.</p>

</div>]","Gov. Tony Evers has wasted no time touting Wisconsin’s new deal with Foxconn.
The Democratic governor negotiated a new deal with the technology giant that would create 1,454 jobs and invest $672 million by 2026. In return, the company will receive a maximum of $80 million in tax subsidies — up to $37 million of which could be paid over the next two years. 
The plan dramatically scales back promises of 13,000 jobs and $10 billion in investment negotiated under former Republican Gov. Scott Walker that would have cost the state nearly $3 billion. But the company’s proposed LCD manufacturing facility in Mount Pleasant never came to fruition, and the company now seems to be shifting its focus to create a wider range of products on that campus. 
Evers contends the new agreement is a better outcome for Wisconsin. 
""We fixed that agreement and found a better deal with Foxconn that will save Wisconsin taxpayers $2.77 billion while still bringing good, family-supporting jobs to Wisconsin,"" he tweeted on April 21, 2021.
We’re going to focus on that number. Does the new Foxconn deal save taxpayers $2.77 billion?
Breaking down the numbers
When asked for evidence to support the governor’s claim, Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback pointed to the difference in tax credits between the new agreement and what Walker negotiated. 
The original plan would have provided Foxconn up to $2.85 billion in tax credits compared to $80 million under the new contract. The new deal includes $60.3 million in job and capital investment credits, plus another $19.7 million in performance credits if Foxconn meets and maintains job projections.
If you subtract $80 million from $2.85 billion, you get the $2.77 billion Evers cited. 
That means when the governor is talking about savings, he’s really referring to how much the state will spend on subsidies. 
But how does that fit into the larger picture of taxpayer dollars?
It’s first worth noting that Wisconsin has not yet given Foxconn any money. 
The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. decided last year not to award tax credits to the company for work done in 2019 after determining it didn’t hire enough people. State officials expected the company to fall short for several more years and therefore didn’t plan to issue any subsidies during that time.

<p>Its headline: ""BUSTED: Melania Trump Lied Under Oath in 2013 About Graduating From College With a ‘Bachelor’s in Architecture.’""</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/melania-trump/"">current biography</a> of Trump on the White House website does not include anything about her educational background.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://casetext.com/brief/merchant-capital-llc-et-al-v-melania-marks-skincare-llc_motion-for-order-barring-or-limiting-topics-of-deposition-testimony"">2013 lawsuit</a> that Racked detailed was a result of a business partner feud and the eventual failure of the holding company of Melania’s heavily promoted skincare line that apparently never made it into stores.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://www.racked.com/2016/8/22/12556786/melania-trump-caviar-skincare-lawsuit"">screenshot of the court deposition</a> shows that an attorney asks Melania to please ""explain to the Judge your formal education including what schools you attended and from which you graduated?"" </p>
<p>""I attended and graduated from design school, from Fashion and Industrial Design School and also attended, graduated from architecture degree, bachelor degree,"" she responds. </p>
<div class=""artembed""><img src=""https://static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/Deposition_screenshot.png""/></div>

</div>]","Claims about first lady Melania Trump lying under oath about her higher education credentials have resurfaced online.
The liberal website ""Political Flare"" posted a story in February 2020 about an answer Melania Trump gave during a 2013 court deposition that involved her defunct caviar skincare line. 
Its headline: ""BUSTED: Melania Trump Lied Under Oath in 2013 About Graduating From College With a ‘Bachelor’s in Architecture.’""
The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, the headline is accurate, but the news is several years old.
Melania previously touted the inaccurate credential on her old website, MelaniaTrump.com, before it was scrubbed in 2016 and its URL rerouted to the Trump Organization website. It now goes to her Facebook page. 
Racked, a defunct fashion blog, in 2016 investigated what happened to Melania Trump’s skincare line, which disappeared along with the website. Its report unraveled a tale about multiple lawsuits between multiple rich people. The story included detail from the deposition in which Melania again provided a false account of her educational background.
A number of reports found that while Melania gained entry to the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, she dropped out in her first year. Shortly after the 2016 election, a new biography on the future first lady was posted on Trump’s website that said she ""paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris."" The change was noted in a number of news reports. ",PolitiFact,"
The current biography of Trump on the White House website does not include anything about her educational background.
The 2013 lawsuit that Racked detailed was a result of a business partner feud and the eventual failure of the holding company of Melania’s heavily promoted skincare line that apparently never made it into stores.
A screenshot of the court deposition shows that an attorney asks Melania to please ""explain to the Judge your formal education including what schools you attended and from which you graduated?"" 
""I attended and graduated from design school, from Fashion and Industrial Design School and also attended, graduated from architecture degree, bachelor degree,"" she responds. 

We reached out to the White House but did not hear back in time for publication.
Evidence and previous reporting shows that Melania falsely stated she graduated college with a bachelor’s degree while under oath. But Political Flare’s inflammatory headline, along with others published by left-leaning websites, makes readers believe this is a new piece of information. It isn’t.
The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

<p>President Donald Trump, no stranger to Twitter, took the social media giant to task in a morning tweet.</p>
<p>""Twitter ‘SHADOW BANNING’ prominent Republicans,"" <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1022447980408983552"">Trump tweeted July 26</a>, ""Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints.""</p>
<div class=""artembed""><a id=""see-figure-1-on-politifactcom""></a><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" data-lang=""en""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Twitter “SHADOW BANNING” prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints.</p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1022447980408983552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">July 26, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async="""" charset=""utf-8"" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script>
</div>
<p>This fed conservative suspicions that the big players like Google, Facebook and Twitter have their thumbs on the scale to give liberal ideas an edge over conservative ones.</p>
<p>Shadow banning, broadly defined, is any practice that limits someone’s reach on the web. In its strongest form on Twitter, a user could send all the tweets he or she liked, but the only person seeing them would be that person.</p>
<p>What Trump was responding to was more subtle. It involved how easy or difficult Twitter made it to find Twitter handles through search. <a href=""https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/43paqq/twitter-is-shadow-banning-prominent-republicans-like-the-rnc-chair-and-trump-jrs-spokesman?"">Vice News</a> reported July 25 that ""Twitter is limiting the visibility of prominent Republicans in search results."" The article focused on the drop-down list that appears when you type a name in Twitter’s search box. Here’s what it looks like if you search for Vice President Mike Pence.</p>
<p><img src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Z48pMrXoi53GYj6GM2bR3sTWIPnFLWt32VfPg1b-cdol2xWHyeGDDB-HGjidunLdJC3nZamFRnWpp6RZ-96s_ZZS3ULXRkN81yRAMZHhLVpob0oAzHTLajFxJyazDihrBxY9C1Al"" style=""border:none; height:290px; width:375px""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Vice News found that the accounts of big name Republicans including Republican Party chair Ronna McDaniel and several conservative Republican congressmen weren’t showing up in the drop-down list. But when they plugged in the names of prominent Democrats, such as the head of the Democratic Party, there was no problem.</p>
<p>The article included this screenshot as proof:</p>
<p><img src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6AASXqCWbkGkWd57wA7jsFZAvWCQOL3N156FWJ5UP7dt-h983PYjo6reM-7D86xl-mcSoayDZjjSI2-stCFIVuQQbPWFVmyKlhdP7qZd7wJnJKse8wEsOmbheHHjaG4E7WHuBcUd"" style=""border:none; height:435px; width:427px""/></p>
<p>But you won’t find that issue now.</p>
<p>By the next day, Vice News updated its article to say, ""Twitter appears to have adjusted its platform overnight to no longer limit the visibility of some prominent Republicans in its search results.""</p>
<p>Florida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz suspected he was a victim of shadow banning. ""Dear @Twitter - are you shadow banning me?,"" he <a href=""https://twitter.com/mattgaetz/status/1021850497882443776"">tweeted July 24</a> citing a YouTube video from a supporter who said Gaetz’s account wasn’t appearing in the drop-down. (The video is no longer available.) Gaetz passed along a tweet from another supporter who noted the same issue.</p>
<p>Gaetz told the conservative <a href=""http://dailycaller.com/2018/07/25/gop-gaetz-fec-twitter-shadow-ban/"">Daily Caller</a> website that he’s seen a dramatic decline in the number of new followers in recent weeks. He linked that to Twitter’s new approach to promote <a href=""https://twitter.com/jack/status/969234275420655616"">what the company called ""conversational health.""</a></p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Twitter’s anti-troll algorithm</div>
<p>In May, Twitter <a href=""https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/Serving_Healthy_Conversation.html"">announced </a>it had launched steps to combat ""troll-like behaviors that distort and detract from the public conversation on Twitter."" It began using various indicators that would affect how an account would appear in search. Not only did Twitter look at what an account was doing on its own, such as often mentioning accounts that don’t follow them, but it also looked at ""how accounts are connected to those that violate our rules and how they interact with each other.""</p>
<p>That’s a pretty wide net, and Twitter product lead Kayvon Beykpour acknowledged the system needed a fix.</p>
<p>""Our usage of the behavior signals within search was causing this to happen and making search results seem inaccurate,"" <a href=""https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1022149077859938304"">Beykpour wrote July 25</a>. ""We’re making a change today that will improve this.""</p>
<div class=""artembed""><a id=""see-figure-3-on-politifactcom""></a><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" data-lang=""en""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">On 2) Some accounts weren’t being auto-suggested even when people were searching for their specific name. Our usage of the behavior signals within search was causing this to happen &amp; making search results seem inaccurate. We’re making a change today that will improve this.</p>— Kayvon Beykpour (@kayvz) <a href=""https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1022149077859938304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">July 25, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async="""" charset=""utf-8"" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script>
</div>
<p>For prominent Republicans, that fix seemed to have worked. Beykpour said the glitch had nothing to do with party affiliation.</p>
<p>""Our behavioral ranking doesn’t make judgements based on political views or the substance of tweets,"" he tweeted.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Political bias or technical artifact</div>
<p>Beykpour’s tweet failed to end suspicions.</p>
<p>""I guess the ‘glitch’ itself was partisan since it only seems to happen to prominent Republicans,"" one skeptic <a href=""https://twitter.com/SharplyRight/status/1022512057390907393"">tweeted</a>. ""Twitter is using its platform to limit speech and shape liberal narrative.""</p>
<p>But Yochai Benkler, co-director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, said his research points to a more benign explanation.</p>
<p>Tracking 1.25 million stories posted throughout the 2016 election season, Benkler and his colleagues found that Republicans are ""part of a media ecosystem that tends to the more extreme right.""</p>
<p>Benkler zeroed in on the part of Twitter’s algorithm that factors in the behavior of other accounts. There could be a guilt-by-association effect.</p>
<p>""If Republican accounts tend to be retweeted or otherwise interacted with by more extremist handles than Democrats are, they would more readily appear to the algorithm as the kind of accounts that are offensive trolls,"" Benkler told us.""The fact that accounts like Infowars and Alex Jones were not shadow banned strongly suggests that this is not a well-designed, intentional intervention, but errors in an imperfect system.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">A final note on legality</div>
<p>Trump called Twitter’s process illegal. Miriam Metzger, communications professor at UC-Santa Barbara said so long as Twitter isn’t discriminating against a protected class of people (think of race or religion), then it’s on safe legal ground.</p>
<p>Benkler echoed the point.</p>
<p>""There is an interesting convergence between left and right political wings to begin to redefine these platforms as public utilities or public forums that cannot exclude speakers at their own whim,"" he said. ""That is not, however, the present state of federal law.""</p>

<html><body><p>The Trump administration has faced fierce <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/31/trumps-tweet-about-migrant-children-deaths-caps-year-that-was-horrible-children/?utm_term=.7b917757bbc9"">criticism</a> for the deaths of two Guatemalan children who were in U.S. custody after crossing the border, but some bloggers are urging Americans to consider that number in context.  </p>
<p>""2 foreign children died due to complications resulting from entering the United States ILLEGALLY!"" reads a Dec. 31 Facebook <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ConservativeReiding/photos/a.1440085059363905/2166394033399667/?type=3&amp;theater"">post</a>. ""2,000 illegal aliens were arrested by ICE in 2017 for MURDERS committed here in the United States! The liberal media is SILENT! THINK ABOUT IT!""</p>
<p>This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related"">partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>
<p>In response to an email asking about the stat, Vincent Picard, a deputy assistant director at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s public affairs office, pointed PolitiFact to the agency’s ""enforcement and removal operations"" <a href=""https://www.ice.gov/doclib/about/offices/ero/pdf/eroFY2018Report.pdf"">report</a> for fiscal year 2018. In a tabulation of the criminal charges and convictions of the people ICE arrested for being in the country illegally that year, the agency lists 2,028 ""total offenses in the homicide column,"" a number that includes 387 charges and 1,641 convictions.</p>
<p>But there are several things to note:</p>
<p>First, the federal fiscal year started Oct. 1, 2017, and ended Sept. 30, 2018. In fiscal year 2017, which started Oct. 1, 2016, and ended Sept. 30, 2017, there were 1,886 total homicide offenses, according to another ICE <a href=""https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report/2017/iceEndOfYearFY2017.pdf"">report</a>.</p>
<p>Second, someone charged with homicide is not necessarily accused of murder. He or she could be accused of <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1112"">manslaughter</a>, the unlawful killing of someone without malice. That could mean killing in the heat of the moment, or accidentally causing someone’s death.</p>
<p>Third, these numbers reflect ICE's administrative arrests, meaning the agency's officers arrested the immigrants for a civil violation of U.S. immigration laws, not for murder.</p>
<p>Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, the 2,028 figure doesn’t represent the number of crimes committed in a given year.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

</div>]","The Trump administration has faced fierce criticism for the deaths of two Guatemalan children who were in U.S. custody after crossing the border, but some bloggers are urging Americans to consider that number in context.  
""2 foreign children died due to complications resulting from entering the United States ILLEGALLY!"" reads a Dec. 31 Facebook post. ""2,000 illegal aliens were arrested by ICE in 2017 for MURDERS committed here in the United States! The liberal media is SILENT! THINK ABOUT IT!""
This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
In response to an email asking about the stat, Vincent Picard, a deputy assistant director at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s public affairs office, pointed PolitiFact to the agency’s ""enforcement and removal operations"" report for fiscal year 2018. In a tabulation of the criminal charges and convictions of the people ICE arrested for being in the country illegally that year, the agency lists 2,028 ""total offenses in the homicide column,"" a number that includes 387 charges and 1,641 convictions.
But there are several things to note:
First, the federal fiscal year started Oct. 1, 2017, and ended Sept. 30, 2018. In fiscal year 2017, which started Oct. 1, 2016, and ended Sept. 30, 2017, there were 1,886 total homicide offenses, according to another ICE report.
Second, someone charged with homicide is not necessarily accused of murder. He or she could be accused of manslaughter, the unlawful killing of someone without malice. That could mean killing in the heat of the moment, or accidentally causing someone’s death.
Third, these numbers reflect ICE's administrative arrests, meaning the agency's officers arrested the immigrants for a civil violation of U.S. immigration laws, not for murder.
Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, the 2,028 figure doesn’t represent the number of crimes committed in a given year.

<html><body><p>Throughout his Republican presidential campaign, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has tried to distance himself from his involvement in a 2013 failed bipartisan immigration bill.</p>
<p>The legislation has <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/jan/29/marco-rubio/did-marco-rubio-flip-flip-amnesty/"">proven to be a liability</a> for Rubio because it contained a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and some of Rubio’s opponents say his support for the bill is evidence that he’s not tough on immigration. On NBC’s <em>Meet the Press</em> Jan. 31, host Chuck Todd asked Rubio if he regretted being part of the Gang of Eight senators who authored the bill.</p>
<p>""Look, I tried to fix the problem,"" Rubio said, referring to illegal immigration. ""This is a real problem. And where are we today? We are worse off today than we were five years ago. We have more illegal immigrants here. We have two unconstitutional executive orders on amnesty. I went to Washington to fix a problem.""</p>
<p>Our ears perked up when Rubio said there are more illegal immigrants in the United States than there were five years ago, so we decided to check the numbers. We found that the latest available data doesn’t support Rubio’s statement.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/22/unauthorized-immigrant-population-stable-for-half-a-decade/"">July 2015</a> headline from the Pew Research Center directly counters Rubio that there are more illegal immigrants than five years ago: ""Unauthorized immigrant population stable for half a decade.""<img src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-i7XXCjBUwuvqb5FCqXdOX02Fdvr_kDa2wX5ThXNTKqMddyPI52Ay1ap_HWlWwciEgC8JP-6v3-BauByjFBFReQp7tAkHcGGE4BBUU7Ys_blOM0AvJUoGZi9-yonbdHnLWAOp69N"" style=""border:none; float:left; height:314px; margin:4px; width:434px""/></p>
<p>Pew found that the number of illegal immigrants living in the United States has seen very little fluctuation, between 2010 and 2014, the latest five-year period of data available — going from 11.4 million in 2010 to 11.3 million in 2014. The illegal immigrant population peaked at 12.2 million in 2007. (See the chart created by Pew to the left.)</p>
<p>The Pew analysis concluded that the illegal immigrant population has been stable the past few years because the number of new immigrants is about equal to the number of those living in the United States who are deported, leave on their own, or die.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/20/what-we-know-about-illegal-immigration-from-mexico/"">Pew also found</a> that the number of illegal immigrants from Mexico, in particular, has been on the decline — going from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007 to 5.6 million in 2014.</p>
<p>The decline in Mexican immigrants is the primary reason why illegal immigration stopped growing, said Robert Warren, a demographer and senior visiting fellow at the <a href=""http://cmsny.org/about-us/staff/"">Center for Migration Studies</a>. He pointed us to his <a href=""http://jmhs.cmsny.org/index.php/jmhs"">own recent research</a> on the subject.</p>
<p>The report’s executive summary says illegal immigration is a hot political topic, in part, because people believe it’s on the rise.

<p>Warren’s report found that the illegal immigrant population has declined every year for the past five years of available data, landing at about 10.9 million illegal immigrants in 2014, down from 11.7 million in 2010.</p>
<p>Why the decline in Mexican immigration?</p>
<p>In a <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/22/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-zero-net-migration-mexico-2010/"">prior fact-check</a>, we found that demographic change is possibly the biggest driver. The birth rate in Mexico has <a href=""http://www3.inegi.org.mx/sistemas/sisept/Default.aspx?t=mdemo16&amp;s=est&amp;c=17535"">fallen steadily since at least 1990</a>. Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute said that translates into fewer people coming into the workforce.</p>
<p>He said apprehensions at the border strongly suggest that fewer people are trying to sneak into the country.<a href=""https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/BP%20Total%20Apps%20FY1925-FY2015.pdf""> Data from the U.S. Border Patrol</a> show a drop in total apprehensions of about 40 percent since 2009. It used to be border agents stopped around a million people <a href=""https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/BP%20Total%20Apps%2C%20Mexico%2C%20OTM%20FY2000-FY2015.pdf"">coming in from Mexico</a> per year. Last year, it was about 188,000.</p>
<p>More surveillance, stiffer penalties and more barriers at the border have had the intended effect, he said.</p>
<p>Other drivers include the hit on the construction industry during the recession. That was a sector that drew many immigrants, and while it has recovered a bit, it is not nearly as robust as it once was. Plus, <a href=""http://immigrationimpact.com/2014/01/14/new-study-highlights-causes-of-return-migration-to-mexico/"">according to one survey</a>, Mexicans who return to their native country generally find that they make more money than when they left.</p>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>Rubio said, ""We have more illegal immigrants here"" than we did five years ago.</p>
<p>Multiple estimates show that the illegal immigrant population has stabilized, or even decreased, from its peak in 2007 through 2014, the latest available data. According to Pew, the illegal immigrant population was 11.3 million in 2014, down from 11.4 million five years prior in 2010. This is in sharp contrast to dramatic and steady increases throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
<p>There is no evidence to support the idea that the illegal immigrant population has grown in the past five years. We rate Rubio’s claim False.</p>

<html><body><p><em><strong>UPDATE, Nov. 7, 2019: </strong>New York Attorney General Letitia James on Nov. 7, 2019, <a href=""https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2019/ag-james-secures-court-order-against-donald-j-trump-trump-children-and-trump"">announced</a> that the New York Supreme Court ordered President Donald J. Trump to pay $2 million in damages ""for improperly using charitable assets to intervene in the 2016 presidential primaries and further his own political interests.""</em></p>
<p><em>As part of the settlement, other stipulations in the lawsuit were resolved, including one related to the Trump family’s involvement with charities. The settlement required mandatory training for the three elder Trump children and imposed restrictions on Donald J. Trump should he join another charity as director. </em></p>
<p><em>Any charity for which Trump serves as a director must have a majority of independent directors (meaning no one in his inner-circle). Also, it must engage counsel with expertise in New York not-for-profit law. And it has to use the services of an accounting firm to monitor and audit the organization’s grants and expenses. If Trump starts a new charity, that charity must also comply with those requirements and report to the New York Attorney General for five years. The settlement includes a ""total ban on any self-dealing,"" as the lawsuit had charged that Trump repeatedly used his foundation's money for his own personal, business, and political interests.</em></p>
<p><em>The settlement, however, does not ban the Trump family from operating a charity in New York, as this original Facebook post claimed. Our ruling on this statement remains unchanged.</em></p>
<p><em>What follows is the original post:</em></p>
<p>A pending lawsuit against President Donald Trump and his three eldest children seeks to prevent them from temporarily being involved in charities in New York. But a Facebook post takes it further by claiming that the family has already been ""disallowed."" That hasn’t happened.</p>
<p>""The Trump family was disallowed from operating any charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity,"" said the Oct. 8 <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10220088222215730&amp;set=a.10210301269948040&amp;type=3&amp;theater"">Facebook post</a> that’s been shared more than 43,000 times.</p>

<p>In June 2018, the New York Attorney General (then Barbara Underwood) filed a <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190925160903/https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2018/attorney-general-underwood-announces-lawsuit-against-donald-j-trump-foundation"">lawsuit</a> against Trump and three of his adult children — Donald J. Trump, Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric F. Trump — and against the Donald J. Trump Foundation. The lawsuit claimed that for more than a decade, the foundation persistently violated state and federal laws related to charities in the state of New York. Trump founded the foundation and served as its president; his three eldest children were on the board of directors.</p>
<p>""This pattern of illegal conduct by the foundation and its board members includes improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations or to implement even elementary corporate formalities required by law,"" the lawsuit said.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>As a result, the lawsuit sought to dissolve the foundation and to temporarily prohibit the Trumps from future service in New York not-for-profit or charitable organizations. Specifically, the lawsuit wants to ban Trump’s involvement for ten years and the three Trump children for one year. The Trump children’s ban would be subject to suspension if they undergo training on related fiduciary duties.</p>
<p>The Donald J. Trump Foundation in December 2018 <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190926132431/https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2018/ag-underwood-announces-stipulation-dissolving-trump-foundation-under-judicial"">agreed to dissolve</a>. But the legal case is still ongoing. A spokesperson for the Office of New York State Attorney General Letitia James said the office could not comment on the pending case.</p>
<p>The Facebook post includes a picture of Trump and his son, Eric, posing for what appears to have been an event for the Eric Trump Foundation and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

</div>]","UPDATE, Nov. 7, 2019: New York Attorney General Letitia James on Nov. 7, 2019, announced that the New York Supreme Court ordered President Donald J. Trump to pay $2 million in damages ""for improperly using charitable assets to intervene in the 2016 presidential primaries and further his own political interests.""
As part of the settlement, other stipulations in the lawsuit were resolved, including one related to the Trump family’s involvement with charities. The settlement required mandatory training for the three elder Trump children and imposed restrictions on Donald J. Trump should he join another charity as director. 
Any charity for which Trump serves as a director must have a majority of independent directors (meaning no one in his inner-circle). Also, it must engage counsel with expertise in New York not-for-profit law. And it has to use the services of an accounting firm to monitor and audit the organization’s grants and expenses. If Trump starts a new charity, that charity must also comply with those requirements and report to the New York Attorney General for five years. The settlement includes a ""total ban on any self-dealing,"" as the lawsuit had charged that Trump repeatedly used his foundation's money for his own personal, business, and political interests.
The settlement, however, does not ban the Trump family from operating a charity in New York, as this original Facebook post claimed. Our ruling on this statement remains unchanged.
What follows is the original post:
A pending lawsuit against President Donald Trump and his three eldest children seeks to prevent them from temporarily being involved in charities in New York. But a Facebook post takes it further by claiming that the family has already been ""disallowed."" That hasn’t happened.
""The Trump family was disallowed from operating any charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity,"" said the Oct. 8 Facebook post that’s been shared more than 43,000 times.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
In June 2018, the New York Attorney General (then Barbara Underwood) filed a lawsuit against Trump and three of his adult children — Donald J. Trump, Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric F. Trump — and against the Donald J. Trump Foundation. The lawsuit claimed that for more than a decade, the foundation persistently violated state and federal laws related to charities in the state of New York. Trump founded the foundation and served as its president; his three eldest children were on the board of directors.
""This pattern of illegal conduct by the foundation and its board members includes improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations or to implement even elementary corporate formalities required by law,"" the lawsuit said.

stated on May 10, 2023 in a Facebook post








New Washington state law allows “government to take away minors from parents if they refuse to agree to gender-transition surgery.”












By Tom Kertscher • May 17, 2023







As a result, the lawsuit sought to dissolve the foundation and to temporarily prohibit the Trumps from future service in New York not-for-profit or charitable organizations. Specifically, the lawsuit wants to ban Trump’s involvement for ten years and the three Trump children for one year. The Trump children’s ban would be subject to suspension if they undergo training on related fiduciary duties.
The Donald J. Trump Foundation in December 2018 agreed to dissolve. But the legal case is still ongoing. A spokesperson for the Office of New York State Attorney General Letitia James said the office could not comment on the pending case.
The Facebook post includes a picture of Trump and his son, Eric, posing for what appears to have been an event for the Eric Trump Foundation and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. St. Jude treats childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. The Eric Trump Foundation raised money for St. Jude. 
Eric Trump’s foundation has also come under scrutiny, but the lawsuit seeking to ban the Trumps’ involvement in New York charities is not tied to the Eric Trump Foundation.
Forbes has reported that Eric Trump’s foundation gave donors the impression that all funds it raised at an annual golf event went to St. Jude, yet more than $500,000 went to other causes; and that at least four groups that received donations from Eric Trump’s foundation later paid for golf tournaments at Trump-owned courses.
Eric Trump in December 2016 resigned from his own foundation, and the foundation restructured and rebranded itself as Curetivity.

<p>We reached out to Kirk and Judicial Watch for comment, but neither has responded with one. It appears they were using old voter registration numbers..</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">An ‘apples-to-oranges measure’</div>
<p>We took a look at the most recent voter registration and population data from Iowa’s government and the Census Bureau. The numbers don’t support what Kirk said, and experts say comparing them is flawed.</p>
<p>Among the counties identified by Judicial Watch, none have more active registered voters than adults. </p>
<p>For example, Scott County — the largest county included in the Judicial Watch story — has an estimated population of 131,961 people ages 18 and older, according to 2018 data from the Census’s American Community Survey. According to the Iowa secretary of state, there are 127,737 total voter registrations, 115,393 of which are active.</p>
<p>Judicial Watch’s story looked at ""total registrations,"" which includes inactive voters. In Iowa, <a href=""https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterreg/voterlistrequests.html"">inactive voters</a> are those that have not responded to notices from the state asking them to verify their registration and residence. </p>
<p>Only one county, Lyon, has more total registered voters than adults: 8,490 to 8,430. But that data is from 2018. The Iowa secretary of state’s office says 8,117 of voters in Lyon County are active.</p>
<p>Either way, <a href=""https://electionlawblog.org/?p=108695"">experts say</a> comparing voter rolls and Census estimates isn’t an accurate measurement of registration rates.</p>
<p>""That’s an apples-to-oranges measure. They measure different things, at different times, with different types of levels of certainty,"" said Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor, in an email. ""And so it’s really bad science to claim that a disconnect between those two numbers means that there’s fraud.""</p>
<p>Even if there were more registered voters than voting-age adults in some Iowa counties, experts told us it would not amount to voter fraud.</p>
<p>""For there to be voter fraud in connection to bloated voter rolls, you’d have to see people going to the polling places and see them voting in places of people who have moved or died,"" said Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California at Irvine. ""Not only would that be a difficult thing to do … you’d have to do this on a wide enough scale to sway an election without being able to verify how the people you’ve paid to do this have voted.""</p>
<p>Voter fraud remains rare in American elections. <a href=""https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/search?state=IA"">A database</a> maintained by the conservative Heritage Foundation has documented 17 confirmed instances of voter fraud in Iowa dating back to 2011.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>A tweet from Charlie Kirk claims that ""EIGHT Iowa counties have more adults registered to vote than voting-aged adults living there.""</p>
<p>Voter registration data and a statement from Iowa’s secretary of state, as well as population estimates from the Census Bureau, refute that claim. And experts say comparing voter data to population estimates isn’t a good measure of registration rates in the first place. </p>

""For there to be voter fraud in connection to bloated voter rolls, you’d have to see people going to the polling places and see them voting in places of people who have moved or died,"" said Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California at Irvine. ""Not only would that be a difficult thing to do … you’d have to do this on a wide enough scale to sway an election without being able to verify how the people you’ve paid to do this have voted.""
Voter fraud remains rare in American elections. A database maintained by the conservative Heritage Foundation has documented 17 confirmed instances of voter fraud in Iowa dating back to 2011.
",PolitiFact,"
A tweet from Charlie Kirk claims that ""EIGHT Iowa counties have more adults registered to vote than voting-aged adults living there.""
Voter registration data and a statement from Iowa’s secretary of state, as well as population estimates from the Census Bureau, refute that claim. And experts say comparing voter data to population estimates isn’t a good measure of registration rates in the first place. 
Kirk’s tweet is inaccurate. We rate it False.

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<p>A video that was viewed or shared by millions of people on social media shows a group of doctors calling for the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, despite warnings from public health experts. </p>
<p><a href=""https://archive.vn/xMPYK"">The clip</a> shows members of a newly created group called America’s Frontline Doctors at a press conference outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. ""We’re here because we feel as though the American people have not heard from all the expertise that’s out there all across our country,"" said Dr. Simone Gold, the founder of America’s Frontline Doctors, in the video.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump <a href=""https://archive.vn/7QMu2"">retweeted</a> clips from the summit before Twitter removed versions of the video. Facebook and YouTube <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/28/tech/facebook-youtube-coronavirus/index.html"">have also worked to remove</a> versions of the video from their sites, although several clips of the 40-plus-minute event were still circulating on Facebook. </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.teapartypatriots.org/foundation/"">Tea Party Patriots</a>, a conservative group that is part of a <a href=""https://www.reopenoureconomy.com/coalition"">coalition</a> to end state lockdowns aimed at preventing the spread of the virus, <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/dark-money-pac-s-coordinated-reopen-push-are-behind-doctors-n1235100"">organized</a> the press conference. Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina introduced the doctors at the beginning of the video. Breitbart, a conservative news site, recorded the event.</p>
<p>Many of the doctors’ claims contradict recommendations from public health organizations and experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The video is the <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/may/14/fact-checking-california-reopen-protest-video/"">latest</a> <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/may/08/fact-checking-plandemic-documentary-full-false-con/"">example</a> of coronavirus misinformation that is packaged as facts to counter more official narratives. </p>
<p>PolitiFact fact-checked several of the video’s most misleading and inaccurate claims below.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Dr. Stella Immanuel: ""This virus has a cure. It is called hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and Zithromax. I know you people want to talk about a mask. Hello? You don’t need a mask. There is a cure.""</div>
<p>This is <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/28/stella-immanuel/dont-fall-video-hydroxychloroquine-not-covid-19-cu/"">False.</a></p>
<p>First, there is no known cure for COVID-19. Supportive care, such as rest, fluids and fever relievers, can assuage symptoms.</p>
<p>Second, in spite of Immanuel’s anecdotal evidence, hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other drugs is not a proven treatment (or cure) for COVID-19. In mid-June, the Food and Drug Administration <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/138945/download"">revoked</a> its emergency authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine and the related drug chloroquine in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>While some studies have found that the drug could help alleviate symptoms associated with COVID-19, <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/apr/08/hydroxychloroquine-and-coronavirus-what-you-need-k/"">the research is not conclusive</a>. <a href=""https://www.goodrx.com/blog/coronavirus-medicine-chloroquine-hydroxychloroquine-as-covid19-treatment/#prevention"">Few studies</a> have been accepted into peer-reviewed journals. And large, randomized trials are still needed to confirm the findings of studies conducted since the pandemic began.</p>
<p>Finally, health officials advise everyone to wear masks in public. The reason why has to do with how the coronavirus spreads. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they expel respiratory droplets containing the virus. Those droplets can then land in the mouths or noses of people nearby.</p>
<p>Since some people infected with the coronavirus may exhibit no symptoms, public health officials say everyone should cover their faces in public — even if they feel well.</p>
<p><em>— Daniel Funke</em></p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Dr. Dan Erickson on lockdowns and reopenings: ""So this measured approach I’m talking about isn’t made up. It’s going on in Sweden, and their deaths are about 564 per million. UK, full lockdown, 600 deaths per million. So we’re seeing that the lockdowns aren’t decreasing significantly the amount of deaths per million.""</div>
<p>These numbers are in the ballpark, but they’re cherry-picked.</p>
<p><a href=""https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality"">According to data</a> from Johns Hopkins University, the fatality rate in Sweden is 55.97 per 100,000 people. The government there <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/business/sweden-economy-coronavirus.html"">did not impose</a> a nationwide stay-at-home order and relied on voluntary social distancing. Meanwhile, the fatality rate in the United Kingdom, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/uk/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-gbr-intl/index.html"">which did</a> implement a mandatory lockdown, is 68.95 per 100,000.</p>
<p>But Erickson’s point that nationwide stay-at-home rules have no effect on COVID-19 deaths doesn’t hold up.</p>
<p>As of July 28, the U.K. had the highest coronavirus deaths per 100,000 people in the world. That could be due to <a href=""https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-five-reasons-why-the-uk-death-toll-is-so-high-140005"">a</a> <a href=""https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/six-reasons-uks-death-toll-21992434"">number</a> of reasons — a delayed lockdown, an aging citizenry, population density — but the country’s stay-at-home rules <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/europe/united-kingdom-coronavirus-cases.html"">did help</a> flatten and eventually decrease the number of new coronavirus cases and deaths.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sweden <a href=""https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-europe-lockdown-effectiveness-graphics/"">had a slower growth rate</a> at the start of the pandemic, but it increased substantially in April. As of July 28, Sweden had the eighth-highest number of coronavirus deaths per 100,000 people in the world — a rate that’s <a href=""https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality"">several times higher</a> than neighboring Finland and Norway, <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-shut-out-coronavirus-reopening-by-finland-norway-denmark-2020-6"">which both</a> implemented nationwide lockdowns. </p>
<p>Other European countries that implemented stay-at-home orders earlier than the U.K. <a href=""https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-europe-lockdown-effectiveness-graphics/"">saw a quicker slowdown</a> in the number of new coronavirus cases. <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-lockdowns-successful-evidence-from-around-the-world-2020-4"">So did cities</a> in Italy and China that were hard-hit in the early days of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Two articles published by Nature <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/06/09/872441984/modelers-suggest-pandemic-lockdowns-saved-millions-from-dying-of-covid-19"">suggest</a> that lockdowns helped slow the transmission of COVID-19.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7.epdf?sharing_token=G_bsQ3B9HDEJJQU8dASH1NRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OnMEHMcInnY-PiC9wHjWf0IuamVsLpQG59lVZSrrMz1da8Q1IFNKy_ogmlk9-0y3HhLR0lT-v14ZX7Sfe7-NnFy9MLlsevOqE1FryJeZxWRaFzeW0ZR5EnPf1kkf4Oxt4%3D"">The first</a> analyzed infection and death rates in 11 European countries through early May. It found that more than 3 million additional people would have died due to the coronavirus if lockdowns were not put in place.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2404-8.epdf?sharing_token=-4c0eJD5MJyvzx6bigOsoNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0M3uHJG_l5lsYP3xOR5eqb7CPPkXGbKYCqSpFTBLPL7jIX0_buyUI_SsKhtJ2DwR0aQRWXiCMCYZ1F4Amu6Xq1k2iyAA7oVJiXjR_-ZbmgcVUhvpuFt_wT7pGrj54g38QQ%3D"">The second</a> article analyzed lockdowns in six countries around the world, including the U.S. It found that stay-at-home measures helped prevent tens of millions of new COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p><em>— Daniel Funke</em></p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Dr. Simone Gold: ""Many states have empowered their pharmacists to not honor physician prescription.""</div>
<p>This is misleading. In efforts to reduce stockpiling, some states have rules and guidance that restrict the dispensing of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment. </p>
<p>In March, before the FDA revoked the emergency authorization of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to treat the virus, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered that pharmacists cannot dispense the drugs except when prescribed for an FDA-approved reason. Other <a href=""https://www.nashp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/State-covid-drug-chart-3-27-2020.pdf"">states enacted similar rules</a>, including Nevada, Ohio, Texas and Idaho, with exceptions including a written diagnosis consistent with evidence for its use. Shortages were creating problems for  patients who take the drugs for conditions other than COVID-19, such as lupus.</p>
<p><em>— Sophie Austin</em></p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Dr. Simone Gold: ""So the case number is almost irrelevant. And that’s because there’s a lot of inaccuracies with the testing. And also even if the test is accurate, most people are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. So it’s not that important to know.""</div>
<p>This ignores how the virus spreads. People without symptoms are able to infect others. As <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-06-10-20-intl/h_3cd73ecd8ce1910f69541e91534e39bc"">early as June</a>, epidemiologists estimated that 25% to 40% of cases were among people who didn’t show symptoms.  </p>
<p>The fraction of tests that come back positive turns out to be an important red flag. Health and Human Services’ Adm. Brett Giroir <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-12-20-admiral-brett-giroir-md/story?id=71739520"">called it</a> a leading indicator. With rising positivity rates, ""we expect hospitalizations to continue to go up,"" he said. That puts a strain on hospitals and ultimately leads to more deaths.</p>

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>Democratic senators skewered Attorney General Jeff Sessions for refusing to answer their questions about his private conversations with President Donald Trump during a June 13 hearing about Sessions’ role in the controversy over Russia and the election.</p>
<p>Sessions said Trump hadn’t invoked <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/jun/11/donald-trump-comeys-leak-memos-totally-illegal/"">executive privilege</a>, which presidents can use to prevent the compelled disclosure of private executive branch communications and deliberations. Instead, Sessions cited ""longstanding"" Justice Department policy as his reason for declining to comment.</p>
<p>""It's a longstanding policy of the Department of Justice not to comment on conversations that the attorney general has had with the president of the United States, for confidential reasons that, really, are founded in the coequal branch powers in the Constitution of the United States,"" Sessions said.</p>
<p>Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., asked Sessions if this policy is in writing somewhere.</p>
<p>""I think so,"" he replied.</p>
<p>So we asked the Justice Department where this policy was written down. Spokesman Ian Prior sent us <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3864782-Olson.html"">two</a> <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3864783-Reaganmemo-1.html"">memos</a> about executive privilege written in 1982, as well as a <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3864784-Memo-From-White-House-Counsel-7-30-09.html"">2009 memo</a> based on the rationale laid out in the 1982 documents.</p>

<p>This rationale — that Sessions needs to talk with the president first before commenting — seems to be in line with the 1982 and 2009 memos.</p>
<p>""Congressional requests for information shall be complied with as promptly and fully as possible, unless it is determined that compliance raises a substantial question of executive privilege,"" says one of the 1982 memos, which President Ronald Reagan issued to the heads of executive branch departments and agencies.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to consider that many of the questions Sessions declined to answer were ones that he could have predicted, given the topic of the hearing, noted Duke University law professor Lisa Kern Griffin, an expert in dishonesty and the law. Sessions deflected questions about details of his conversations with Trump about the Russia investigation or the firing of FBI director James Comey.</p>
<p>So Sessions could have asked Trump in advance of the hearing whether an executive privilege invocation would be appropriate.</p>
<p>""Basically (Sessions) is trying to gain the benefits of claiming executive privilege without its political or legal consequences,"" said Heidi Kitrosser, an expert in government transparency and professor at the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>To fully abide with the policies outlined in the Justice Department memos, Sessions should have made it clear that he planned to consult with Trump about the questions Congress asked him, Kitrosser added.</p>
<p>If Sessions continues to refuse to answer Congress’ questions, and Trump doesn’t invoke executive privilege, Congress could ultimately hold him in contempt or impeach him, said Jamal Greene, a constitutional law professor at Columbia University.</p>
<p>""That remedy is, however, highly unlikely,"" he said.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in his former life as a senator, Sessions asked Attorney General Eric Holder about his private conversations with President Barack Obama during a congressional hearing in January 2014. (Bloomberg View Executive Editor Tim O’Brien <a href=""https://twitter.com/TimOBrien/status/874729929610600451 "">uncovered</a> this example.)</p>
<p>""Did he consult with you before he made that statement?"" Sessions asked, during a January 2014 hearing, regarding a comment President Barack Obama made to the New Yorker about marijuana.</p>
<p>""No, we didn't talk about that,"" Holder replied.</p>
<p>This exchange between Holder and Sessions doesn’t automatically refute Sessions’ reasoning, however. We don’t know if Obama cleared Holder to talk about their conversations about marijuana legalization, or if Holder didn’t think his statement raised a substantial question of executive privilege.</p>
<p>In 2012, Congress <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/politics/fast-and-furious-holder-contempt-citation-battle.html?mcubz=0"">held Holder in contempt</a> for refusing to provide records related to the Fast and Furious scandal. The Obama White House had <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/26/politics/pol-fast-furious/"">invoked</a> executive privilege in that case, though a federal judge <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/judge-rejects-obamas-executive-privilege-claim-over-fast-and-furious-records-217970"">rejected</a> that decision in 2016.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>Sessions said, ""It's a longstanding policy of the Department of Justice not to comment on conversations that the attorney general has had with the president of the United States.""</p>
<p>The Justice Department provided us with memos from 1982 and 2009 about executive privilege. They do not say outright that attorneys general can’t ever comment on conversations with the president.</p>
<p>However, they do guide the attorney general to consult with the White House before responding to congressional inquiries that may involve confidential communications with the president. This is the rationale Sessions invoked later in his testimony.</p>

</div>]","Democratic senators skewered Attorney General Jeff Sessions for refusing to answer their questions about his private conversations with President Donald Trump during a June 13 hearing about Sessions’ role in the controversy over Russia and the election.
Sessions said Trump hadn’t invoked executive privilege, which presidents can use to prevent the compelled disclosure of private executive branch communications and deliberations. Instead, Sessions cited ""longstanding"" Justice Department policy as his reason for declining to comment.
""It's a longstanding policy of the Department of Justice not to comment on conversations that the attorney general has had with the president of the United States, for confidential reasons that, really, are founded in the coequal branch powers in the Constitution of the United States,"" Sessions said.
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., asked Sessions if this policy is in writing somewhere.
""I think so,"" he replied.
So we asked the Justice Department where this policy was written down. Spokesman Ian Prior sent us two memos about executive privilege written in 1982, as well as a 2009 memo based on the rationale laid out in the 1982 documents.

Memo From White House Counsel 7 30 09 (Text)


 
Based on Sessions’ testimony, we were looking for the memos to say that an attorney general should not comment on conversations he or she has had with a president or top White House officials, full stop.
But that’s not exactly what the memos say. They acknowledge that the executive branch has an expectation that its communications remain confidential, so they guide the attorney general to consult with the White House counsel about congressional information requests involving White House communications. Then, the president can decide whether to invoke executive privilege to keep those communications confidential if necessary.
In his testimony, Sessions said he didn’t want to answer certain questions without first giving Trump the opportunity to decide whether it would be appropriate to share that information with Congress or keep it confidential.
""It would be premature for me to deny the president a full and intelligent choice about executive privilege,"" Sessions said.
""It is improper for agents of any of the department (or) any departments in the executive branch to waive that privilege without a clear approval of the president,"" he added later.

<html><body><p>Having lost his early lead in the delegate count to Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has a lot riding on his appeal to blue-collar workers.</p>
<p>Speaking days ahead of the Michigan primary on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Sanders said his opposition to major trade deals marked a sharp difference between him and Biden, the former Delaware senator and vice president.</p>
<p>""Trade agreements like NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China, which forced American workers to compete against people making pennies an hour, have resulted in the loss of 160,000 jobs here in Michigan,"" Sanders <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-march-8-2020-n1152446?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=New%20Campaign&amp;utm_term=First%20Read"">said from Grand Rapids on March 8</a>. ""I helped lead the effort, as you may recall, against these disastrous trade agreements. I worked with the unions, not with the CEOs of large corporations. On the other hand, Joe Biden strongly supported these agreements.""</p>
<p>While he voiced some reservations at the time, Biden voted for both bills — the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, and normalization of trade with China in 2000. </p>
<p>In this fact-check, we look at whether the two agreements cost Michigan 160,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Teasing out the impact of trade deals can be difficult. There’s lots going on in the economy regardless of tariff agreements, including the 2008-09 financial crisis that plunged two of Detroit’s hometown auto companies into bankruptcy. But overall, studies back up Sanders’ claim.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">The big picture with China</div>
<p>Sanders’ point hinges on trade with two countries, Mexico and China. But of the two, U.S. trade with China was much larger, and with that came a bigger impact.</p>
<p>The studies Sanders relied on estimated Michigan’s job losses at nearly 44,000 (as of 2010) <a href=""https://www.epi.org/files/page/-/BriefingPaper308.pdf"">due to NAFTA</a>, and about <a href=""https://www.epi.org/publication/growing-china-trade-deficits-costs-us-jobs/"">112,000 due to China</a> (as of 2018). We’ll get to those estimates in just a bit, but add them together and you get 156,000, which is essentially Sanders’ number.</p>
<p>But first, focusing just on China, the <a href=""https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4746/f/bhkl_posted_draft.pdf"">latest research by a group of economists from four universities</a> offers a broad picture of what took place after 2000 when the United States gave it permanent normal trade status. </p>
<p>The group’s study doesn’t put a number to Michigan’s losses, but it does highlight its struggles.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the study found that the ultimate effect on jobs nationwide was neutral, neither a gain nor a loss. </p>
<p>But among regions of the country, the upheaval was substantial. Both the type of jobs and the location of jobs shifted.</p>
<p>""Chinese competition reallocated employment from manufacturing to services, and from the U.S. heartland to the coasts,"" the report said.</p>
<p>A Midwest state like Michigan was on the losing end of the deal.</p>
<p>This research dug down to the level of individual companies and found that large multinational companies offshored manufacturing jobs and expanded service jobs, in areas such as research and management, in the U.S.</p>
<p>The study also found that the China effect disappeared after 2007.</p>
<p>""We find strong employment impacts from 2000 to 2007, but nothing since from 2008 to 2015,"" the authors wrote.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Michigan manufacturing jobs rose, then plummeted</div>
<p>Sanders is correct that both NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China exposed Michigan to competition from factories that paid their workers much less and spent less on worker safety and environmental protection. </p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>But the manufacturing employment numbers reveal one of the challenges to drawing quick conclusions on the impact of the two trade deals. The job numbers show different paths after passage of each trade agreement. (Passage of trade bills is marked in red.)</p>
<div class=""artembed""><a id=""see-figure-1-on-politifactcom""></a><script id=""infogram_0_cb96c6a1-85f6-40e1-95b7-0fd00fa4c9c9"" src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js?nF0"" title=""Michigan manufacturing jobs"" type=""text/javascript""></script></div>
<p> </p>
<p>After NAFTA, the number of manufacturing jobs rose to 888,000. After the China deal, the number fell to 638,000 (as of 2006 and before the Great Recession), a decline of 250,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The raw numbers support the idea that the China impact was great. For NAFTA, the analysis is more complicated.</p>
<p>Economist Susan Houseman at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., said those rising manufacturing job numbers after NAFTA passed don’t tell the whole story. She said the studies Sanders used are valid.</p>
<p>""The country was experiencing record job growth in the 1990s, so you wouldn’t necessarily expect the number of manufacturing jobs to fall,"" Houseman said. ""Rather you might expect for them to grow more slowly.""</p>
<p>The fraction of all jobs that were in manufacturing did fall by one percentage point between 1993 and 2000, suggesting that NAFTA did more for sectors other than manufacturing.</p>
<div class=""artembed""><a id=""see-figure-2-on-politifactcom""></a><script id=""infogram_0_b9b27795-450d-45b8-978a-4c716d66fb96"" src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js?2ZZ"" title=""Michigan manu jobs as percent"" type=""text/javascript""></script></div>
<p>Houseman also said that the NAFTA impacts would play out over time, as companies built new plants in Mexico, something that could not happen overnight.</p>
<p>The analysis Sanders relied on came from economist Robert Scott at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.epi.org/files/page/-/BriefingPaper308.pdf"">For NAFTA</a>, Scott took the rising U.S.-Mexico trade deficit and teased out how that translated into job effects at the state level. Between 1993 and 2010, and accounting for the Great Recession, Scott found a loss of 43,600 jobs in Michigan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Houseman said that is a conservative figure.</p>
<p>""The types of calculations in this, if anything, may understate job losses,"" she said. ""I don’t believe there is any basis for calling the Sanders claim of job losses for Michigan wrong.""</p>
<p>The primary caveat for Scott’s estimate is that it’s for 2010, which is a decade ago. Michigan’s manufacturing sector has recovered a bit since then. However, for workers who lost their jobs during the first decade of the 2000s, the disruption was real. And even after rebounding, manufacturing remains well short of where it stood before NAFTA.</p>
<p><a href=""https://economics.mit.edu/files/11643"">Multiple</a> studies also lend weight to Scott’s overall findings of the impact on the Midwest from trade with China. Research by economists <a href=""http://faculty.som.yale.edu/peterschott/files/research/papers/pierce_schott_pntr_512.pdf"">Justin Pierce at the Federal Reserve and Peter Schott at Yale </a>University, suggests over 1 million jobs nationwide have been lost due to trade with China.</p>
<p>Some economists argue that productivity gains played a major role in displacing manufacturing jobs, but recent work casts doubt on how productivity has been calculated. Studies of the impact of automation find that it has been significant, but much <a href=""https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/20-071_8259fe86-8c56-4975-a213-2f67e0e2b1d1.pdf"">less than competition from China</a>.</p>

</div>]","Having lost his early lead in the delegate count to Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has a lot riding on his appeal to blue-collar workers.
Speaking days ahead of the Michigan primary on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Sanders said his opposition to major trade deals marked a sharp difference between him and Biden, the former Delaware senator and vice president.
""Trade agreements like NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China, which forced American workers to compete against people making pennies an hour, have resulted in the loss of 160,000 jobs here in Michigan,"" Sanders said from Grand Rapids on March 8. ""I helped lead the effort, as you may recall, against these disastrous trade agreements. I worked with the unions, not with the CEOs of large corporations. On the other hand, Joe Biden strongly supported these agreements.""
While he voiced some reservations at the time, Biden voted for both bills — the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, and normalization of trade with China in 2000. 
In this fact-check, we look at whether the two agreements cost Michigan 160,000 jobs.
Teasing out the impact of trade deals can be difficult. There’s lots going on in the economy regardless of tariff agreements, including the 2008-09 financial crisis that plunged two of Detroit’s hometown auto companies into bankruptcy. But overall, studies back up Sanders’ claim.
The big picture with China
Sanders’ point hinges on trade with two countries, Mexico and China. But of the two, U.S. trade with China was much larger, and with that came a bigger impact.
The studies Sanders relied on estimated Michigan’s job losses at nearly 44,000 (as of 2010) due to NAFTA, and about 112,000 due to China (as of 2018). We’ll get to those estimates in just a bit, but add them together and you get 156,000, which is essentially Sanders’ number.
But first, focusing just on China, the latest research by a group of economists from four universities offers a broad picture of what took place after 2000 when the United States gave it permanent normal trade status. 
The group’s study doesn’t put a number to Michigan’s losses, but it does highlight its struggles.
Interestingly, the study found that the ultimate effect on jobs nationwide was neutral, neither a gain nor a loss. 
But among regions of the country, the upheaval was substantial. Both the type of jobs and the location of jobs shifted.
""Chinese competition reallocated employment from manufacturing to services, and from the U.S. heartland to the coasts,"" the report said.
A Midwest state like Michigan was on the losing end of the deal.
This research dug down to the level of individual companies and found that large multinational companies offshored manufacturing jobs and expanded service jobs, in areas such as research and management, in the U.S.
The study also found that the China effect disappeared after 2007.
""We find strong employment impacts from 2000 to 2007, but nothing since from 2008 to 2015,"" the authors wrote.
Michigan manufacturing jobs rose, then plummeted
Sanders is correct that both NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China exposed Michigan to competition from factories that paid their workers much less and spent less on worker safety and environmental protection.

Tom Price undercounts Obamacare impact on getting more Americans insured

<div adbridg-ad-class=""mobileinterstitial""></div>
<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>Republicans supporting the House GOP’s effort to repeal and replace Obamacare are pushing back on criticism that the plan would strip health insurance away from an <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2017/3/7/14844446/standard-poors-sp-ahca-obamacare-repeal-replace"">estimated 6 million to 15 million Americans.</a></p>
<p>In comments on the Sunday shows March 12, surrogates for President Donald Trump drew a distinction between being insured and being able to access affordable health care.</p>
<p>Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price also made the case that the number of new people insured as a result of Obamacare can be overstated.</p>
<p>""The number of individuals who actually got coverage through the exchange who didn't have coverage before, or who weren't eligible for Medicaid before is relatively small,"" Price said on <em>Meet the Press</em>. ""So we've turned things upside down completely for 3 million, or 4 million, or 5 million individuals.""</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>The passage of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, did result in a spate of Medicaid enrollees who were previously eligible for the program (about 3.2 million). But beyond that, Price’s claim falls apart. </p>
<p><strong>3 million to 5 million new enrollees? No</strong></p>
<p>Price focused on two pools of people -- those who benefited from the plan to expand Medicaid and uninsured Americans who purchased coverage through a federal or state exchange or marketplace.</p>
<p>Through that lens, Price’s figures are off.</p>
<p>Nonpartisan health care analysts at the Kaiser Family Foundation have concluded that, <a href=""http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/medicaid-expansion-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D"">as of March 2016</a>, more than 11 million Americans have gained access to health care as part of the Medicaid expansion. As we noted, an additional 3.2 million Americans signed up for Medicaid but were previously eligible.</p>
<p>Finding data on the number of previously uninsured people who signed up for care through a health care exchange is more challenging. But the numbers that do exist further undercut Price.</p>
<p>In 2015, researchers at the nonpartisan <a href=""http://www.rand.org/news/press/2015/05/06.html"">RAND Corporation estimated that 4.1 million previously uninsured Americans</a> had gained access through a health care exchange or marketplace.</p>
<p>That’s roughly 15 million Americans who weren’t insured who now are, which is three to five times the number Price used.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.commonwealthfund.org/about-us/experts/glied-sherry-a"">Sherry A. Glied</a>, dean of the Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service at New York University, recently examined how much of a factor the Affordable Care Act is playing in cutting the uninsured rate.</p>
<p>Looking at the Affordable Care Act’s first open enrollment period (2013-14), <a href=""http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2016/dec/aca-declining-uninsured-rate"">Glied concluded</a> that the health care law explained about 76 percent of the decline in the uninsured rate. Glied told us that translates to 9.8 million more people covered as a result of the health care law’s policies in 2014.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>""Since then, the uninsurance rate has dropped further,"" Glied said, which would mean the pool of people covered because of Affordable Care Act policies has grown.</p>
<p><strong>That Medicaid expansion figure could be bigger</strong></p>
<p>It’s important to note that the health care law actually was designed so that even more people would receive health care through the Medicaid expansion.</p>
<p>Historically, Medicaid coverage had been focused primarily on pregnant women, children and the disabled. Under the Affordable Care Act, eligibility was to be expanded to nearly all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. As part of the law, the federal government agreed to cover 100 percent of the cost of newly eligible people through 2016, 95 percent in 2017, 94 percent in 2018, 93 percent in 2019, and 90 percent in 2020 and beyond.</p>
<p>The original plan was that every state would expand the program, but a 2012 Supreme Court decision allowed each state to decide for itself.</p>
<p>To date, 19 states have refused to expand Medicaid eligibility -- creating a gap in coverage.</p>
<p>How big is the gap?</p>
<p>Kaiser estimates an additional <a href=""http://kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/the-coverage-gap-uninsured-poor-adults-in-states-that-do-not-expand-medicaid/"">2.5 million people</a> were intended to get health care as part of the Affordable Care Act but have not.</p>
<p><strong>What Price didn’t mention about the ACA</strong></p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act included another provision to cover people who previously might be uninsured. The Department of Health and Human Services <a href=""https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/187551/ACA2010-2016.pdfPrice "">estimated in 2016 that 2.3 million young adults</a> gained health care from 2010 to October 2013 as a result of a provision of the law that allows people under age 26 to stay on a parent’s plan.</p>
<p>The House GOP proposal retains that specific provision.</p>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>Price said, ""The number of individuals who actually got coverage through the exchange who didn't have coverage before, or who weren't eligible for Medicaid before is relatively small. So we've turned things upside down completely for 3 million, or 4 million, or 5 million individuals.""</p>

</div>]","Republicans supporting the House GOP’s effort to repeal and replace Obamacare are pushing back on criticism that the plan would strip health insurance away from an estimated 6 million to 15 million Americans.
In comments on the Sunday shows March 12, surrogates for President Donald Trump drew a distinction between being insured and being able to access affordable health care.
Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price also made the case that the number of new people insured as a result of Obamacare can be overstated.
""The number of individuals who actually got coverage through the exchange who didn't have coverage before, or who weren't eligible for Medicaid before is relatively small,"" Price said on Meet the Press. ""So we've turned things upside down completely for 3 million, or 4 million, or 5 million individuals.""
Is that correct?
The passage of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, did result in a spate of Medicaid enrollees who were previously eligible for the program (about 3.2 million). But beyond that, Price’s claim falls apart. 
3 million to 5 million new enrollees? No
Price focused on two pools of people -- those who benefited from the plan to expand Medicaid and uninsured Americans who purchased coverage through a federal or state exchange or marketplace.
Through that lens, Price’s figures are off.
Nonpartisan health care analysts at the Kaiser Family Foundation have concluded that, as of March 2016, more than 11 million Americans have gained access to health care as part of the Medicaid expansion. As we noted, an additional 3.2 million Americans signed up for Medicaid but were previously eligible.
Finding data on the number of previously uninsured people who signed up for care through a health care exchange is more challenging. But the numbers that do exist further undercut Price.
In 2015, researchers at the nonpartisan RAND Corporation estimated that 4.1 million previously uninsured Americans had gained access through a health care exchange or marketplace.
That’s roughly 15 million Americans who weren’t insured who now are, which is three to five times the number Price used.
Sherry A. Glied, dean of the Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service at New York University, recently examined how much of a factor the Affordable Care Act is playing in cutting the uninsured rate.
Looking at the Affordable Care Act’s first open enrollment period (2013-14), Glied concluded that the health care law explained about 76 percent of the decline in the uninsured rate. Glied told us that translates to 9.8 million more people covered as a result of the health care law’s policies in 2014.

By Gabrielle Settles • April 24, 2023







""Since then, the uninsurance rate has dropped further,"" Glied said, which would mean the pool of people covered because of Affordable Care Act policies has grown.
That Medicaid expansion figure could be bigger
It’s important to note that the health care law actually was designed so that even more people would receive health care through the Medicaid expansion.
Historically, Medicaid coverage had been focused primarily on pregnant women, children and the disabled. Under the Affordable Care Act, eligibility was to be expanded to nearly all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. As part of the law, the federal government agreed to cover 100 percent of the cost of newly eligible people through 2016, 95 percent in 2017, 94 percent in 2018, 93 percent in 2019, and 90 percent in 2020 and beyond.
The original plan was that every state would expand the program, but a 2012 Supreme Court decision allowed each state to decide for itself.
To date, 19 states have refused to expand Medicaid eligibility -- creating a gap in coverage.
How big is the gap?
Kaiser estimates an additional 2.5 million people were intended to get health care as part of the Affordable Care Act but have not.
What Price didn’t mention about the ACA
The Affordable Care Act included another provision to cover people who previously might be uninsured. The Department of Health and Human Services estimated in 2016 that 2.3 million young adults gained health care from 2010 to October 2013 as a result of a provision of the law that allows people under age 26 to stay on a parent’s plan.
The House GOP proposal retains that specific provision.

<p>The whistleblower has legal protection from retaliation and U.S. officials have kept that person’s name confidential.

<p>In his historic testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh defiantly accused Democrats and the Clintons of orchestrating a political ""hit"" to keep Kavanaugh off the country’s highest court.</p>
<p>The statement was controversial enough. But some heard Kavanaugh go even further, saying that if confirmed to bench, ""what goes around comes around.""</p>
<p>""Perhaps the most chilling line in Kavanaugh's speech was, 'what goes around, comes around.' He did not say it with any evident sadness, nor did he renounce it as a value,"" Jonathan Chait <a href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/09/kavanaugh-would-be-the-trumpiest-supreme-court-justice.html"">wrote</a> in New York magazine. ""Here was a man apparently threatening revenge on his political enemies, and asking for a lifetime appointment with supreme power of judicial review with which to do it.""</p>
<p>"" 'What goes around comes around' sounds like a threat,"" <a href=""https://twitter.com/KirstenPowers/status/1045392467992997894"">said</a> USA Today columnist and CNN contributor Kirsten Powers.</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., took to Twitter to vent on the day that the FBI gave senators the results of its supplemental investigation into allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh.</p>
<p>""After I spend my 5 min today with the single copy of the FBI report I will be thinking of how Kavanaugh calls Democrats 'embarrassments', thinks we are engaged in conspiracy against him on behalf of the Clintons, and promises when he’s on the Court 'what goes around comes around'.""</p>

</div>
<p>There's enough discussion about Kavanaugh's comments that we think it's important to show his words in context, so you can interpret whether he was threatening Democrats or making some other point.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href=""https://plus.cq.com/doc/congressionaltranscripts-5396108?2"">relevant passage</a> from Kavanaugh’s testimony on Sept. 27, in which he blasted his critics as partisans trying to keep him off the court through what he termed a last-minute smear.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:36pt"">""This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election. Fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record. Revenge on behalf of the Clintons. And millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:36pt"">""This is a circus. The consequences will extend long past my nomination. The consequences will be with us for decades. This grotesque and coordinated character assassination will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions, from serving our country.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:36pt"">""And as we all know, in the United States political system of the early 2000s,<strong> what goes around comes around.</strong> I am an optimistic guy. I always try to be on the sunrise side of the mountain, to be optimistic about the day that is coming. But today, I have to say that I fear for the future.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:36pt"">""Last time I was here, I told this committee that a federal judge must be independent, not swayed by public or political pressure. I said I was such a judge. And I am.""</p>

<p>A combined total of 1,409,483 votes were cast in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, the state’s two largest cities. Guiliani’s statement suggests that over 40% of them were illegal. His 600,000 figure is roughly equal to the entire number of mail-in ballots that were cast for Biden in the two cities.</p>
<p>The state Republican Party is challenging a state Supreme Court ruling that allowed for counting mailed ballots that arrive within three days after polls closed on Election Day. State election officials said about 10,000 mail ballots were received during those three days. The state has kept those ballots separate, <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/09/republican-lawsuits-challenging-election-pennsylvania-arizona-nevada-havent-gone-far-heres-why/6227596002/"">pending a resolution</a> of the GOP challenge. The state did not include them in tallies that led the state to be called for Biden.</p>
<p>Some have suggested that many ballots were counted without legally required oversight. We recently rated <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/06/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-falsely-claims-philadelphia-counting-vote/"">False</a> a claim along those lines from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/12/donald-trump/trumps-wrong-claim-election-observers-were-barred-/"">debunked</a> a claim from Trump that Republican observers were barred. We found no evidence that ballots were inappropriately cast or that observers were barred from watching.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania law that established mail-in voting and allows observers to be present when mail ballots are opened and recorded was passed by a Republican Legislature.</p>
<p>""Any laws around poll watchers apply equally to both major parties and any third parties,"" said Suzanne Almeida, interim executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania. ""I have seen no evidence that one party’s poll watchers have been treated any differently than the other.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>Giuliani said over 600,000 votes were unlawful in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. There is no evidence to back that up.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania law allows representatives from both parties to observe the count, and Republicans in the state told a judge that they did have monitors in the room.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s Department of State denied that any votes were improperly counted.</p>
<p>We rate this claim Pants on Fire.</p>

</div>]","In Pennsylvania, Democrat Joe Biden got about 54,000 more votes than President Donald Trump. Some Trump supporters reject that tally, claiming without evidence that tens or even hundreds of thousands of ballots were counted illegitimately.
""It’s more like 600,000 plus unlawful votes in Philly and Pitt,"" Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani tweeted Nov. 11.
Tom, it’s more like 600,000 plus unlawful votes In Philly and Pitt. https://t.co/5pdNiDXqKt— Rudy W. Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) November 12, 2020 
We reached out to Giuliani’s communications director to ask where he got his number  and did not hear back.
The Pennsylvania Department of State, which oversees elections, says the former New York mayor’s claim is unfounded. We found no rationale or explanation for how so many votes could have been fraudulently cast.
""There is no factual basis for this claim,"" said agency communications director Wanda Murren. ""Allegations of fraud and illegal activity have been repeatedly debunked and dismissed by the courts.""
A U.S. District Court judge rebuffed a GOP suit that claimed Republican observers had been unfairly barred from certain areas of the Philadelphia Convention Center where mailed ballots were counted. Pressed by the judge, Republicans acknowledged that they did have representatives on the scene.
Democrats and Republicans then established more detailed ground rules for how many party representatives would observe the count.

Featured Fact-check
















Donald Trump


stated on April 30, 2023 in a Truth Social post








A Florida elections bill “guts everything” “instead of getting tough, and doing what the people want (same day voting, Voter ID, proof of Citizenship, paper ballots, hand count, etc.).”












By Amy Sherman • May 3, 2023







A combined total of 1,409,483 votes were cast in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, the state’s two largest cities. Guiliani’s statement suggests that over 40% of them were illegal. His 600,000 figure is roughly equal to the entire number of mail-in ballots that were cast for Biden in the two cities.
The state Republican Party is challenging a state Supreme Court ruling that allowed for counting mailed ballots that arrive within three days after polls closed on Election Day. State election officials said about 10,000 mail ballots were received during those three days. The state has kept those ballots separate, pending a resolution of the GOP challenge. The state did not include them in tallies that led the state to be called for Biden.
Some have suggested that many ballots were counted without legally required oversight. We recently rated False a claim along those lines from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and debunked a claim from Trump that Republican observers were barred. We found no evidence that ballots were inappropriately cast or that observers were barred from watching.
The Pennsylvania law that established mail-in voting and allows observers to be present when mail ballots are opened and recorded was passed by a Republican Legislature.
""Any laws around poll watchers apply equally to both major parties and any third parties,"" said Suzanne Almeida, interim executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania. ""I have seen no evidence that one party’s poll watchers have been treated any differently than the other.""
",PolitiFact,"
Giuliani said over 600,000 votes were unlawful in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. There is no evidence to back that up.
Pennsylvania law allows representatives from both parties to observe the count, and Republicans in the state told a judge that they did have monitors in the room.
Pennsylvania’s Department of State denied that any votes were improperly counted.
We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>In his bid to win the southern Wisconsin U.S. House seat held by GOP Speaker <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/personalities/paul-ryan/"">Paul Ryan</a>, Democrat <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/personalities/randy-bryce/"">Randy Bryce</a> is also running against President <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/"">Donald Trump</a>.</p>
<p>The iron worker and union leader, who has raised more than <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/15/paul-ryan-challenger-randy-bryce-reports-raising-1-2-million-end-2017/1034593001/"">$1 million</a>, criticized Trump at a Jan. 10, 2018 <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/RandyBryce2018/videos/544085179281163/"">campaign event</a> in Racine, saying:</p>
<p><em>His own legislation, what he wants to do as far as (unintelligible) immigrants, his own family would not have been allowed into the country, based on what he's doing.</em></p>
<p>In other words, if legislation backed by Trump had been in place years ago, would his own family have been barred from entering the United States?</p>
<p>As we’ll see, Bryce points to two family members -- Trump’s paternal grandfather and his current wife -- and pending legislation that would create a point system for qualifying to immigrate to the United States.</p>
<p>What we found is that odds would have been against -- perhaps heavily against -- both Friedrich Trump and Melania Trump, but that Bryce’s declaration goes too far. There are a number of unknowns, particularly with Melania, which means there isn’t evidence to prove she would not have been allowed to immigrate.</p>
<p><strong>Pending immigration legislation</strong></p>
<p>The Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act was introduced in August 2017 and <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-backs-raise-act/"">endorsed by Trump</a> and is pending in the U.S. Senate. It is <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/08/02/trump-gop-senators-to-introduce-bill-to-slash-legal-immigration-levels/?utm_term=.10d8c5bc26ed"">aimed at reducing</a> legal immigration levels by <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/us/politics/trump-immigration.html"">half over a decade</a>.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1720"">The bill</a>, <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1403/limit-legal-immigration/"">as reported by</a> PolitiFact National, would shift legal immigration into the United States from a system favoring family reunification to one based on skills and merit.</p>
<p>People applying to immigrate would have to achieve at least 30 points under a system that would award points based primarily on age (younger is better), education (especially science and technology advanced degrees), ability to speak English, an offer of a high-paying job having been made and bringing along more than $1 million to invest.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/23/upshot/immigration-quiz-raise-act-trump.html"">The New York Times</a> offered a test you can take online and it quoted an economist who estimated that only 2 percent of Americans would get the 30 points needed just to be considered for immigration.</p>
<p><strong>The test</strong></p>
<p>Here’s another quick version of the <a href=""http://time.com/4887574/trump-raise-act-immigration/"">test, offered by TIME</a>, followed by our analysis of how Friedrich and Melania Trump might have scored had the RAISE legislation been in place when they came to the United States.</p>

<p>A <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/08/03/under-trumps-new-immigration-rule-his-own-grandfather-likely-wouldnt-have-gotten-in/?utm_term=.304fad1943ab"">Washington Post analysis</a> cited to us by Bryce’s campaign noted Friedrich Trump’s <a href=""https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/the-man-who-made-trump-who-he-is-121647"">lack of English-speaking</a> and lack of high-level job skills, and concluded that had the RAISE Act been in place, Trump ""would likely not have gained entry to the United States.""</p>
<p>Washington University law professor emeritus <a href=""http://law.wustl.edu/faculty/pages.aspx?id=274"">Stephen Legomsky</a>, an immigration law specialist, went further. He told us that ""even under the most favorable assumptions, it’s extremely unlikely"" that Friedrich Trump would have amassed the minimum of 30 points just to be considered for immigration. Syracuse University political science professor <a href=""https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/psc/Cohen,_Elizabeth_F_/"">Elizabeth Cohen</a>, whose specialties include immigration, called Friedrich’s chances ""highly unlikely.""</p>
<p>Gwenda Blair, a Columbia University journalism adjunct faculty member and author of <a href=""http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Trumps/Gwenda-Blair/9780743210799"">The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President</a>, helped us understand why Friedrich would have had such an uphill battle. She told us that before Friedrich immigrated, he had little, if any English-speaking skills; almost certainly had not finished high school; having trained as a <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/an-immigrant-named-trump"">barber’s apprentice</a>, almost certainly would not have had a high-paying job awaiting him in New York; and, coming from a low-income family, almost certainly would not have had a large sum of money to invest.</p>
<p>As for the first lady, the case is not overly favorable, but also not clear cut.</p>
<p><strong>Wife Melania Trump</strong></p>
<p>Bryce’s campaign pointed us to a San Jose (Calif.) <a href=""https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/08/09/melania-trump-wouldnt-pass-her-husbands-merit-based-immigration-test/"">Mercury News article</a>. It declared that if RAISE were in place when <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/personalities/melania-trump/"">Melania Trump</a> arrived with a temporary visa ""she wouldn’t stand a chance of being able to stay.""</p>
<p>According to the Mercury News: Melania, a native of Slovenia, first came to the United States, at age 26, on a tourist visa in August 1996. A few months later, she obtained an H-1B visa for skilled workers. There’s some question about whether she did some modeling work before getting her H-1B visa as well as how she obtained a green card in 2001. She married Trump in 2006 and became a U.S. citizen. ""At best, Melania could probably score about 21 points, so there would be no visa for her,"" the article said.</p>
<p>She did have more going for her than Friedrich did.</p>
<p><strong>English:</strong> Melania currently speaks English with a heavy accent, but it’s one of five languages she’s <a href=""http://fortune.com/2017/09/20/melania-trump-photo-billboard-english/"">reportedly</a> <a href=""https://www.politico.eu/article/melania-trump-learn-a-little-bit-of-english/"">fluent in</a>. There’s no way to know, at the time she came to the United States, whether her English-speaking skills would have earned her zero points, 12, or some number in between.</p>
<p><strong>Education:</strong> Melania briefly studied architecture and design at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia. But, <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/donald-melania-trump-marriage"">according to Vanity Fair</a>, she dropped out after winning runner-up in a beauty contest. So, for a high school diploma or the equivalent, that’s one point.</p>
<p><strong>Job awaiting:</strong> At age 18, in Milan, Italy, Melania signed on with a modeling agency that said it sponsored the visa that brought her to New York in 1996. In New York in 1996, Melania would have needed a starting salary of at least $53,100 to earn any points, according to Cohen.</p>
<p><strong>Means: </strong>Another unknown is whether Melania could have brought along a large sum of money, even if that seems unlikely. Melania’s father managed a chain of car and motorcycle dealerships, and her mother was either a fashion designer or a garment factory worker, according to <a href=""https://nypost.com/2015/08/16/melania-trump-would-be-a-first-lady-for-the-ages/"">the New York Post</a>. She would have earned points if she could have come over with the current equivalent of more than $1.35 million.</p>
<p>Legomsky, the Washington University law professor, pointed out that even if Melania amassed 30 points, which he said was unlikely, it would be difficult for her to be chosen for immigration given that more applicants would have much higher scores. But he said he could not say for certain. Syracuse’s Cohen said Melania ""probably would have come close"" to hitting 30 points, and potentially could have exceeded 30, depending on her English proficiency and the salary of her first job.</p>
<p>The White House responded to our request seeking information about Bryce’s claim, but did not provide any information.</p>
<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>
<p>Bryce says that under Donald Trump’s ""own legislation,"" Trump's ""own family would not have been allowed into the country.""</p>
<p>It seems unlikely, perhaps highly unlikely, that either Trump’s grandfather or his wife would have earned enough points under the legislation to be eligible for immigration. But, particularly with Melania Trump, it can’t be known for certain.</p>

</div>]","In his bid to win the southern Wisconsin U.S. House seat held by GOP Speaker Paul Ryan, Democrat Randy Bryce is also running against President Donald Trump.
The iron worker and union leader, who has raised more than $1 million, criticized Trump at a Jan. 10, 2018 campaign event in Racine, saying:
His own legislation, what he wants to do as far as (unintelligible) immigrants, his own family would not have been allowed into the country, based on what he's doing.
In other words, if legislation backed by Trump had been in place years ago, would his own family have been barred from entering the United States?
As we’ll see, Bryce points to two family members -- Trump’s paternal grandfather and his current wife -- and pending legislation that would create a point system for qualifying to immigrate to the United States.
What we found is that odds would have been against -- perhaps heavily against -- both Friedrich Trump and Melania Trump, but that Bryce’s declaration goes too far. There are a number of unknowns, particularly with Melania, which means there isn’t evidence to prove she would not have been allowed to immigrate.
Pending immigration legislation
The Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act was introduced in August 2017 and endorsed by Trump and is pending in the U.S. Senate. It is aimed at reducing legal immigration levels by half over a decade.
The bill, as reported by PolitiFact National, would shift legal immigration into the United States from a system favoring family reunification to one based on skills and merit.
People applying to immigrate would have to achieve at least 30 points under a system that would award points based primarily on age (younger is better), education (especially science and technology advanced degrees), ability to speak English, an offer of a high-paying job having been made and bringing along more than $1 million to invest.
The New York Times offered a test you can take online and it quoted an economist who estimated that only 2 percent of Americans would get the 30 points needed just to be considered for immigration.
The test
Here’s another quick version of the test, offered by TIME, followed by our analysis of how Friedrich and Melania Trump might have scored had the RAISE legislation been in place when they came to the United States.




How old are you?
Under 18 cannot apply
18-21 6 points
22-25 8 points
26-30 10 points
31-35 8 points
36-40 6 points
41-45 4 points
46-50 2 points
Over 50 0 points
What's your highest level of education?
Less than high school diploma 0 points
High school diploma or foreign equivalent 1 point
Foreign bachelor's 5 points
U.S. bachelor's 6 points
Foreign master's in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics 7 points
U.S. master’s in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics 8 points
Foreign professional degree or doctorate in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics 10 points
U.S. professional degree or doctorate in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics 13 points
What's your English ability?
Poor 0 points
Moderate 6 points
Good 10 points
Excellent 11 points
Fluent 12 points
Do you have a job offer?
No 0 points
Yes, with a salary less than $77,900 0 points
Yes, with a salary of at least $77,900 5 points
Yes, with a salary of at least $103,900 8 points
Yes, with a salary of at least $155,800 13 points
Do you have a Nobel Prize or major international award?
Yes 25 points
No 0 points
Have you won an Olympic medal in the past 8 years?
Yes 15 points
No 0 points
Do you plan on investing money in the U.S.?
No 0 points
Yes, with foreign currency worth less than $1.35 million for a new commercial enterprise 0 points
Yes, with foreign currency worth between $1.35 million and $1.8 million for a new commercial enterprise 6 points
Yes, with foreign currency worth at least $1.8 million for a new commercial enterprise 12 points




 
Grandfather Friedrich Trump
Friedrich Trump immigrated from Germany to the United States in 1885 at age 16. Under RAISE, he could not have applied for immigration until he turned 18.",PolitiFact,"
A Washington Post analysis cited to us by Bryce’s campaign noted Friedrich Trump’s lack of English-speaking and lack of high-level job skills, and concluded that had the RAISE Act been in place, Trump ""would likely not have gained entry to the United States.""
Washington University law professor emeritus Stephen Legomsky, an immigration law specialist, went further. He told us that ""even under the most favorable assumptions, it’s extremely unlikely"" that Friedrich Trump would have amassed the minimum of 30 points just to be considered for immigration. Syracuse University political science professor Elizabeth Cohen, whose specialties include immigration, called Friedrich’s chances ""highly unlikely.""
Gwenda Blair, a Columbia University journalism adjunct faculty member and author of The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President, helped us understand why Friedrich would have had such an uphill battle. She told us that before Friedrich immigrated, he had little, if any English-speaking skills; almost certainly had not finished high school; having trained as a barber’s apprentice, almost certainly would not have had a high-paying job awaiting him in New York; and, coming from a low-income family, almost certainly would not have had a large sum of money to invest.
As for the first lady, the case is not overly favorable, but also not clear cut.
Wife Melania Trump
Bryce’s campaign pointed us to a San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News article. It declared that if RAISE were in place when Melania Trump arrived with a temporary visa ""she wouldn’t stand a chance of being able to stay.""
According to the Mercury News: Melania, a native of Slovenia, first came to the United States, at age 26, on a tourist visa in August 1996. A few months later, she obtained an H-1B visa for skilled workers. There’s some question about whether she did some modeling work before getting her H-1B visa as well as how she obtained a green card in 2001. She married Trump in 2006 and became a U.S. citizen. ""At best, Melania could probably score about 21 points, so there would be no visa for her,"" the article said.
She did have more going for her than Friedrich did.
English: Melania currently speaks English with a heavy accent, but it’s one of five languages she’s reportedly fluent in. There’s no way to know, at the time she came to the United States, whether her English-speaking skills would have earned her zero points, 12, or some number in between.
Education: Melania briefly studied architecture and design at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia. But, according to Vanity Fair, she dropped out after winning runner-up in a beauty contest. So, for a high school diploma or the equivalent, that’s one point.
Job awaiting: At age 18, in Milan, Italy, Melania signed on with a modeling agency that said it sponsored the visa that brought her to New York in 1996. In New York in 1996, Melania would have needed a starting salary of at least $53,100 to earn any points, according to Cohen.
Means: Another unknown is whether Melania could have brought along a large sum of money, even if that seems unlikely. Melania’s father managed a chain of car and motorcycle dealerships, and her mother was either a fashion designer or a garment factory worker, according to the New York Post. She would have earned points if she could have come over with the current equivalent of more than $1.35 million.
Legomsky, the Washington University law professor, pointed out that even if Melania amassed 30 points, which he said was unlikely, it would be difficult for her to be chosen for immigration given that more applicants would have much higher scores. But he said he could not say for certain. Syracuse’s Cohen said Melania ""probably would have come close"" to hitting 30 points, and potentially could have exceeded 30, depending on her English proficiency and the salary of her first job.
The White House responded to our request seeking information about Bryce’s claim, but did not provide any information.
Our rating
Bryce says that under Donald Trump’s ""own legislation,"" Trump's ""own family would not have been allowed into the country.""
It seems unlikely, perhaps highly unlikely, that either Trump’s grandfather or his wife would have earned enough points under the legislation to be eligible for immigration. But, particularly with Melania Trump, it can’t be known for certain.

<html><body><p>During a recent press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre played down the impact of President Joe Biden’s policies on inflation. </p>
<p>Inflation has recently been at a 40-year high. Many economists say the American Rescue Plan — the coronavirus relief package that Biden, with only Democratic support in Congress, signed into law shortly after taking office in 2021 — has contributed to the rise in prices. Critics say putting more money in Americans’ pockets when they didn’t need the assistance has been a contributor to inflation, along with pandemic-related supply-chain troubles and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, both of which have disrupted flows of energy, food and other goods.</p>
<p>At a <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/06/13/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre/"">June 13 press briefing</a>, Jean-Pierre played defense against the notion that the American Rescue Plan had a role in worsening inflation. The issue came up when a reporter asked about the precipitous drop in the stock market that day; by the end of the day, the benchmark <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history/"">Standard &amp; Poors 500 </a>had fallen by nearly 4%, pushing stocks into <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/14/the-sp-500-closed-in-a-bear-market-on-monday-what-does-that-mean.html#:~:text=A%20bear%20market%20is%20a,perhaps%20triggering%20an%20economic%20downturn."">bear market</a> territory, which is defined as the markets losing at least 20% of their value from recent highs.</p>
<p>""We know that the high prices are having a real effect on people's lives,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""We get that. And we are incredibly focused on doing everything that we can to make sure that the economy is working for the American people. But we are coming out of the strongest job market in American history, and that matters. And a lot of that is thanks to the American Rescue Plan, which only Democrats voted for, and Republicans did not. It led to this historic economic boom that we're seeing with jobs.""</p>
<p>The reporter followed up by asking, ""Didn’t it also lead to historic inflation?"" </p>
<p>Jean-Pierre responded, ""That is not how we're seeing the American Rescue Plan. … We have to remember what the president walked into. When he walked into this administration, the economy was at a standstill. Schools were closed. Businesses were shutting down. Twenty million people were on unemployment insurance benefits. That is what he walked into.""</p>
<p>A reader asked us whether Jean-Pierre was correct to say that when Biden ""walked into this administration …  20 million people were on unemployment insurance benefits.""</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre’s figure is way off.</p>
<p>To check what Jean-Pierre said, we looked at two federal statistics.</p>
<p>The first is the <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNEMPLOY/"">number of unemployed Americans</a>, estimated every month from a federal survey of households. The unemployment level did peak at about 23 million people in April 2020, right when the economy was closing down due to the coronavirus. But that was nine months before Biden took office — and the number fell significantly before Biden was sworn in.</p>

<p>By January 2021, when Biden was being sworn in, the number of unemployed Americans had fallen by more than half, to 10.2 million. So according to this metric, Jean-Pierre cited a figure roughly double the actual number.</p>

<p>Trump does enjoy strong support among Republican voters. But no public poll backs up the stellar performance he touted. We emailed the White House to point us to the poll Trump relied on. We did not hear back.</p>

<p>We checked out whether Trump’s Republican approval was at an all-time high, both at this point in comparable tenures or all-time, as he said.</p>
<p>At this point in his administration (around the 860-day mark), Trump’s approval comes in a bit behind George W. Bush, who held a 94% approval rating within his party, as did his father George H.W. Bush. Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon brought up the rear, getting the nod from just 79% of Republican voters in May of their third year in office. Here’s the full picture, going back to Dwight Eisenhower.</p>
<div class=""artembed""><a id=""see-figure-2-on-politifactcom""></a><script id=""infogram_0_982b7fae-4a4a-4352-9cbd-52080dd67cfb"" src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js?pUW"" title=""GOP polls: May year 3"" type=""text/javascript""></script></div>
<p>Trump once claimed that he had the highest polling numbers ""in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan."" <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/30/donald-trump/has-donald-trump-had-highest-poll-numbers-any-gop-/"">We rated that False</a>. Not only have other presidents in the recent past enjoyed higher numbers, but there is no data from Lincoln’s time. That is pure invention.</p>
<p>For real record-setting, look to George W. Bush who, <a href=""https://news.gallup.com/interactives/185273/presidential-job-approval-center.aspx"">according to Gallup</a>, won approval from 99% of Republicans in the month after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>Trump said, ""I’ve had tremendous Republican support. I have a 90% — 94% approval rating, as of this morning, in the Republican Party. That’s an all-time record.""</p>
<p>While his numbers hold steady in the mid-to-high 80s, no poll puts him at 94%. Nor did the White House point to a poll with that level of support. Still, 87% or 89% approval is a strong showing.</p>
<p>Where Trump went overboard was in saying he had set some kind of all-time record. That didn’t happen.</p>
<p>The statement as a whole is partially accurate, so we rate it Half True.</p></body></html>

""I think if they do, it’s foolish,"" Trump said June 4. ""I’ve had tremendous Republican support. I have a 90% — 94% approval rating, as of this morning, in the Republican Party. That’s an all-time record. Can you believe that? Isn’t that something? I love records.""
Trump does enjoy strong support among Republican voters. But no public poll backs up the stellar performance he touted. We emailed the White House to point us to the poll Trump relied on. We did not hear back.
Looking at support among Republican voters, Trump’s highest number in the latest polls is 87% from Gallup. CNN comes in second at 86%. The other four are lower.

All polls are based on surveys done at the end of May. No margin of error, among the polls that provide them, would be large enough to deliver the 94% that Trump claimed.
Setting no records
Trump’s approval among Republicans has generally held in the mid-to-high 80s, which would qualify as robust. Gallup clocked in a slightly higher number of 90% in March and April. That sort of shift is within the normal variation in polling.

People are participating in “National Rape Day’” on April 24.












By Gabrielle Settles • April 24, 2023







We checked out whether Trump’s Republican approval was at an all-time high, both at this point in comparable tenures or all-time, as he said.
At this point in his administration (around the 860-day mark), Trump’s approval comes in a bit behind George W. Bush, who held a 94% approval rating within his party, as did his father George H.W. Bush. Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon brought up the rear, getting the nod from just 79% of Republican voters in May of their third year in office. Here’s the full picture, going back to Dwight Eisenhower.

Trump once claimed that he had the highest polling numbers ""in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan."" We rated that False. Not only have other presidents in the recent past enjoyed higher numbers, but there is no data from Lincoln’s time. That is pure invention.
For real record-setting, look to George W. Bush who, according to Gallup, won approval from 99% of Republicans in the month after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
",PolitiFact,"
Trump said, ""I’ve had tremendous Republican support. I have a 90% — 94% approval rating, as of this morning, in the Republican Party. That’s an all-time record.""
While his numbers hold steady in the mid-to-high 80s, no poll puts him at 94%. Nor did the White House point to a poll with that level of support. Still, 87% or 89% approval is a strong showing.
Where Trump went overboard was in saying he had set some kind of all-time record. That didn’t happen.
The statement as a whole is partially accurate, so we rate it Half True.

<p>That’s a mischaracterization of the barrier that won Democratic support 13 years ago.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/109-2006/s262"">Just over half of</a> Democrats in the Senate voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was signed into law by President George W.

<p>A 2016 <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/01/unfinished-us-mexico-border-wall-texas-secure-fence-act"">Associated Press</a> report from the border described the fencing as ""rust-colored thick bars"" that form ""teeth-like slats."" That includes the steel fence dividing Nogales in Arizona and Mexico, which is between 18 and 26 feet tall. ""There are miles of gaps between segments and openings in the fence itself,"" the AP reported.</p>
<p>The Democrats’ offer to Trump is a continuing resolution on last year’s <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1397/build-wall-and-make-mexico-pay-it/"">appropriations act</a>, which provided $1.3 billion for fencing and additional money for other types of border security. The language made it so that the funds could only be used on repairing or extending fencing that had already been built under the 2006 law.</p>

<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>Trump said Schumer has ""has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected president.""</p>
<p>Schumer, along with tens of other Democrats including former President Barack Obama, voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. That’s the majority of the barrier in place today along the southern border.</p>
<p>However, the fence was mocked as a ""nothing wall"" by Trump in the past and was far less ambitious, both politically and physically, than the wall Trump wants to build now.</p>
<p>Finally, Trump says the Democrats no longer support their previous position simply because he wants it. But Democrats have actually proposed current funding for the fencing that was approved in 2006. </p>

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>Republican frontrunner Donald Trump’s challengers have called him many things; add to that list the charge from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio that Trump is a con man. Rubio's recent attacks have focused on allegations of false marketing by Trump University.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a real university -- and had to change its name to Trump Entrepreneur Institute because of that. It was largely a seminar program that promised to teach its students the real estate secrets that turned Trump into a billionaire. With some participants paying as much as $35,000, the project drew investigations and lawsuits in at least three states.</p>
<p>The university registered as a private company in New York in October 2004 and largely shut down by 2011. When NBC host Chuck Todd raised issues with the university, Trump defended the program, noting that nearly all the students thought it was ""great.""</p>
<p>""They signed these documents saying, they rated the course, 98 percent approval rating and high marks,"" Trump said on <em>Meet the Press</em> on <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-february-28-2016-n527506"" style=""text-decoration: none;""><u>Feb. 28, 2016</u></a>. And he added, ""We have an A from the Better Business Bureau.""</p>
<p style=""text-align:center""><a href=""http://bit.ly/politifactgive""><strong>HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER</strong></a></p>
<p>We went to the <a href=""http://www.bbb.org/new-york-city/business-reviews/training-programs/the-trump-entrepreneur-initiative-in-new-york-ny-97075/"" style=""text-decoration: none;""><u>Better Business Bureau</u></a> website and saw that as of today, the Trump Entrepreneur Institute has no rating. The website explained, ""This business has no rating because BBB has information indicating it is out of business.""</p>
<p>Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told us, ""When the school was operational it was rated A.""</p>
<p>We asked Hicks to document that rating and didn’t hear back.</p>
<p>Katherine Hutt, director of communications for the Council of Better Business Bureaus, said that as a matter of policy, they don’t provide any ratings from previous years.<strong> </strong>But the organization issued a statement that ""Over the years, the company’s BBB rating has fluctuated between an A+ and a D-.""</p>
<p>We don’t know when the bureau might have given Trump University a top grade, but based on the <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20100420184236/http://www.bbb.org/new-york-city/business-reviews/training-programs/trump-university-in-new-york-ny-97075/"" target=""_blank"">Internet Archive</a>, the last time the Better Business Bureau gave the university any rating at all was 2010, when it give it a D-minus.

<p>That year, the <em>New York Daily News</em> <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/trump-u-hit-complaints-paid-30g-return-article-1.446342"" style=""line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;""><u>reported that</u></a> ""the Better Business Bureau in January slapped a D-minus rating on Trump U., a rating now under review after Trump U. objected.""</p>
<p>CBS News said the same thing in an <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-trump-university-flunking-out/"" style=""text-decoration: none;""><u>April 21, 2010</u></a>, article.</p>
<p>And  in <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/nyregion/trumps-for-profit-school-said-to-be-under-investigation.html"" style=""text-decoration: none;""><u>May, 2011</u></a>, the <em>New York Times</em> wrote ""The Better Business Bureau gave the school a D-minus for 2010, its second-lowest grade, after receiving 23 complaints.""</p>
<p>The <em>Washington Post</em> had the same information in <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/post/names-and-faces-donald-trumps-for-profit-school-under-investigation-pete-doherty-is-back-in-jail-marion-cotillard-has-a-baby-boy/2011/05/20/AFirUz7G_blog.html"" style=""text-decoration: none;""><u>May 2011</u></a> when it reported that the New York State Attorney General was investigating the Trump Entrepreneur Institute. The Attorney General’s Office did file charges but stumbled on the grounds that the statute of limitations had passed.  The matter is under appeal.</p>
<p>Under the new name Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, ratings ranged from C to B between 2012 and 2014. We found no ratings at all for the past two years.</p>

<p>Trump said about his entrepreneur institute that ""we have an ‘A’ from the Better Business Bureau."" Literally speaking, that is inaccurate. The Better Business Bureau gives the program no rating today because it’s no longer a going concern.</p>
<p>Trump University had an A at some point. The Better Business Bureau doesn't release details of its past ratings, but it did say Trump's program had ratings that ranged from A+ to D-.</p>
<p>What we do know, from several published reports and archived Web pages, is that the university had a D in 2010 and under its new name, had ratings ranging from C to B, with no ratings after March 2014.</p>
<p>Trump’s claim is literally wrong and also ignores the university’s lower Better Business Bureau scores. We rate it False.</p>

</div>]","Republican frontrunner Donald Trump’s challengers have called him many things; add to that list the charge from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio that Trump is a con man. Rubio's recent attacks have focused on allegations of false marketing by Trump University.
It wasn’t a real university -- and had to change its name to Trump Entrepreneur Institute because of that. It was largely a seminar program that promised to teach its students the real estate secrets that turned Trump into a billionaire. With some participants paying as much as $35,000, the project drew investigations and lawsuits in at least three states.
The university registered as a private company in New York in October 2004 and largely shut down by 2011. When NBC host Chuck Todd raised issues with the university, Trump defended the program, noting that nearly all the students thought it was ""great.""
""They signed these documents saying, they rated the course, 98 percent approval rating and high marks,"" Trump said on Meet the Press on Feb. 28, 2016. And he added, ""We have an A from the Better Business Bureau.""
HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER
We went to the Better Business Bureau website and saw that as of today, the Trump Entrepreneur Institute has no rating. The website explained, ""This business has no rating because BBB has information indicating it is out of business.""
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told us, ""When the school was operational it was rated A.""
We asked Hicks to document that rating and didn’t hear back.
Katherine Hutt, director of communications for the Council of Better Business Bureaus, said that as a matter of policy, they don’t provide any ratings from previous years. But the organization issued a statement that ""Over the years, the company’s BBB rating has fluctuated between an A+ and a D-.""
We don’t know when the bureau might have given Trump University a top grade, but based on the Internet Archive, the last time the Better Business Bureau gave the university any rating at all was 2010, when it give it a D-minus. That assessment showed up in plenty of news articles.

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>An old rumor that claims posting a legal message on your Facebook wall will stop the social media company from using your photos and status updates has surfaced yet again.</p>
<p>And it is just as false now as it was when it popped up nearly <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/facebook-copyright-hoax-copy-paste-copyright-facebook-message/story?id=17811357"">seven years ago.</a></p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=882818462056827&amp;set=a.148852332120114&amp;type=3&amp;theater"">faux warning</a> says:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 36pt;"">""An attorney advised us to post this. The violation of privacy can be punished by law. NOTE: Facebook is now a public entity. All members must post a note like this. If you do not publish a statement at least once, it will be tacitly understood that you are allowing the use of your photos, as well as the information contained in your profile status updates. I HEREBY STATE THAT I DO NOT GIVE MY PERMISSION. Copy and re-post.""</p>
<p>The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related"">our partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>
<p>This online rumor <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/facebook-copyright-hoax-copy-paste-copyright-facebook-message/story?id=17811357"">first appeared</a> <a href=""https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/facebook-posts-made-public/"">in November 2012</a> when Facebook started trading <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111015/when-did-facebook-go-public.asp"">publicly</a>, and while the language is slightly tweaked from earlier iterations, the message remains the same: Post this or else Facebook has control of your content.</p>
<p>But it isn’t that simple. Facebook users cannot just undo the privacy or copyright terms they agreed to when they first signed up and made an account. As well, simply posting a notice will not have any impact on new policy changes.</p>
<p>In 2012, the rumor spread around the same time Facebook announced it was considering <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/2493392/facebook-to-revoke-users--right-to-vote-on-policy-changes.html"">removing users’ rights</a> to vote on policy changes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it isn’t so much your status updates or photos that Facebook is necessarily interested in, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/update"">it’s your data.</a></p>
<p>Facebook, as well as other websites, wants to know your age, gender, hometown, marital status, religion, general interests … anything that will help it better target advertisements to you.

</div>]","An old rumor that claims posting a legal message on your Facebook wall will stop the social media company from using your photos and status updates has surfaced yet again.
And it is just as false now as it was when it popped up nearly seven years ago.
The faux warning says:
""An attorney advised us to post this. The violation of privacy can be punished by law. NOTE: Facebook is now a public entity. All members must post a note like this. If you do not publish a statement at least once, it will be tacitly understood that you are allowing the use of your photos, as well as the information contained in your profile status updates. I HEREBY STATE THAT I DO NOT GIVE MY PERMISSION. Copy and re-post.""
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
This online rumor first appeared in November 2012 when Facebook started trading publicly, and while the language is slightly tweaked from earlier iterations, the message remains the same: Post this or else Facebook has control of your content.
But it isn’t that simple. Facebook users cannot just undo the privacy or copyright terms they agreed to when they first signed up and made an account. As well, simply posting a notice will not have any impact on new policy changes.
In 2012, the rumor spread around the same time Facebook announced it was considering removing users’ rights to vote on policy changes.
The company released a statement at the time to address the rumor:

Instagram posts


stated on April 23, 2023 in an Instagram post








Brain aneurysms are a “serious and common COVID-19 mRNA vaccine injury in young people.”












By Loreben Tuquero • April 25, 2023







""There is a rumor circulating that Facebook is making a change related to ownership of users' information or the content they post to the site. This is false. Anyone who uses Facebook owns and controls the content and information they post, as stated in our terms. They control how that content and information is shared. That is our policy, and it always has been.""
That policy hasn’t changed either, according to the company’s terms of service:
""You own the content you create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook Products you use, and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content,"" Facebook says.
Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as service providers that support our service or other Facebook Products you use.
You can end this license any time by deleting your content or account. You should know that, for technical reasons, content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies (though it will not be visible to other users). In addition, content you delete may continue to appear if you have shared it with others and they have not deleted it.""
Meanwhile, it isn’t so much your status updates or photos that Facebook is necessarily interested in, it’s your data.
Facebook, as well as other websites, wants to know your age, gender, hometown, marital status, religion, general interests … anything that will help it better target advertisements to you. You can visit Facebook’s data policy page for more information.
",PolitiFact,"
An old refurbished rumor claims that posting a message on your Facebook wall will effectively bar the company from using your photos and information.
The rumor has been debunked as a hoax for some time and does not override Facebook’s terms of use that users agree to when they sign-up.

So, has the federal agency charged with ensuring healthy conditions in the workplace declared that face coverings don’t work, and actually pose a health risk?
That’s the claim of an article (archived here) widely shared on Facebook that carries this headline:

<p><a href=""https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/er/labor_standards/minimum_wage.htm"">Wisconsin’s $7.25</a>, by the way, is the same as the <a href=""https://www.dol.gov/whd/minimumwage.htm"">federal minimum wage</a>, both of which have been in place since 2009.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Labor, <a href=""https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/america.htm"">as of July 1, 2017</a>, Wisconsin and Iowa were among 14 states with a minimum wage at $7.25 per hour. Twenty-nine states, plus the District of Columbia, had higher rates, with D.C.’s being the highest, at $12.50.</p>
<p>The federal rate applies in states that have minimum wage laws at rates below the federal rate, or that have no minimum wage law at all.</p>
<p>For the record, a Times <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/us/politics/paul-ryan-interview.html"">news article</a> said Ryan made it clear in the interview that he opposes legislation to change the federal minimum wage, saying: ""For every wage you raise, you actually end up losing jobs.

Some bloggers and Facebook users say that’s a mistake.</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20200705202306/https://off-guardian.org/2020/06/27/covid19-pcr-tests-are-scientifically-meaningless/"">a June 27 article</a>, a website called OffGuardian wrote that the tests many health care providers use to diagnose COVID-19 are ""scientifically meaningless.""</p>
<p>""These PCR tests are meaningless as a diagnostic tool to determine an alleged infection by a supposedly new virus called SARS-CoV-2,"" reads the article, which has been shared more than thousands of times on Facebook.</p>

<p>OffGuardian was launched in 2015. The site’s name comes from the fact that its founders were all ""banned from the Guardian’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/mar/14/welcometocommentisfree"">‘Comment is Free’ sections</a>,"" according to <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20200706083519/https://off-guardian.org/"">its about section</a>.</p>
<p>OffGuardian <a href=""https://www.stopfake.org/en/russian-trolls-exiled-from-guardian-find-home-for-their-hate/"">has a track record</a> of publishing conspiracy theories and Russian propaganda, so we wanted to take a closer look at its claim about COVID-19 testing.</p>
<p>The article is inaccurate — polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are among the most common and reliable ways to test for the coronavirus. Similar claims <a href=""https://sciencefeedback.co/claimreview/pcr-tests-for-covid-19-are-specific-for-the-novel-coronavirus-sars-cov-2-and-do-not-detect-other-coronaviruses-contrary-to-claims-in-viral-article-and-video/"">have</a> <a href=""https://teyit.org/en/were-pcr-tests-wrong-50/"">circulated</a>, and have been fact-checked, since March.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/may/05/coronavirus-testing-what-we-know-all-one-place/"">There are</a> three main coronavirus tests: diagnostic, antibody and antigen. Diagnostic tests, also known as PCR tests, look for the genetic material of the coronavirus in a sample that’s typically taken from a person’s nose or throat. Health care providers and public health officials use them to confirm whether someone has the disease.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Factsheet-for-Patients-2019-nCoV.pdf"">In a fact sheet</a> for its PCR test, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the test is ""designed to detect the virus that causes COVID-19 in respiratory specimens, for example nasal or oral swabs.""</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>""If you have a positive test result, it is very likely that you have COVID-19,"" the document says.</p>
<p>That’s because PCR tests <a href=""https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Polymerase-Chain-Reaction-Fact-Sheet"">amplify small segments of DNA</a>, making it easier for labs to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Health care providers have <a href=""https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive-health/hiv-aids/diagnosis/pcr.html"">also used them</a> for detecting viruses like HIV. It usually takes several days to get results. </p>
<p>In its 4,500-word article, OffGuardian lays out several (inaccurate) theories about PCR tests. None of them prove that the tests are ""scientifically meaningless.""</p>
<p>OffGuardian wrote in its article that the inventor of the PCR test, Kary Mullis, ""regarded the PCR as inappropriate to detect a viral infection."" <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-pcr/fact-check-inventor-of-method-used-to-test-for-covid-19-didnt-say-it-cant-be-used-in-virus-detection-idUSKBN24420X"">In a fact-check</a>, Reuters rated that claim false — the source is a 1996 article about HIV/AIDS. It does not say PCR tests are ineffective for detecting viruses.</p>
<p>OffGuardian makes several other inaccurate claims in its article, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>""There are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19."" The CDC <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html"">says otherwise</a>.</p>

</div>]","The United States has ramped up its COVID-19 testing capacity this summer in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Some bloggers and Facebook users say that’s a mistake.
In a June 27 article, a website called OffGuardian wrote that the tests many health care providers use to diagnose COVID-19 are ""scientifically meaningless.""
""These PCR tests are meaningless as a diagnostic tool to determine an alleged infection by a supposedly new virus called SARS-CoV-2,"" reads the article, which has been shared more than thousands of times on Facebook.
The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has also been copy-pasted into text posts, which have also been shared thousands of times.

(Screenshot from Facebook)
OffGuardian was launched in 2015. The site’s name comes from the fact that its founders were all ""banned from the Guardian’s ‘Comment is Free’ sections,"" according to its about section.
OffGuardian has a track record of publishing conspiracy theories and Russian propaganda, so we wanted to take a closer look at its claim about COVID-19 testing.
The article is inaccurate — polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are among the most common and reliable ways to test for the coronavirus. Similar claims have circulated, and have been fact-checked, since March.
There are three main coronavirus tests: diagnostic, antibody and antigen. Diagnostic tests, also known as PCR tests, look for the genetic material of the coronavirus in a sample that’s typically taken from a person’s nose or throat. Health care providers and public health officials use them to confirm whether someone has the disease.
In a fact sheet for its PCR test, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the test is ""designed to detect the virus that causes COVID-19 in respiratory specimens, for example nasal or oral swabs.""",PolitiFact,"
""If you have a positive test result, it is very likely that you have COVID-19,"" the document says.
That’s because PCR tests amplify small segments of DNA, making it easier for labs to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Health care providers have also used them for detecting viruses like HIV. It usually takes several days to get results. 
In its 4,500-word article, OffGuardian lays out several (inaccurate) theories about PCR tests. None of them prove that the tests are ""scientifically meaningless.""
OffGuardian wrote in its article that the inventor of the PCR test, Kary Mullis, ""regarded the PCR as inappropriate to detect a viral infection."" In a fact-check, Reuters rated that claim false — the source is a 1996 article about HIV/AIDS. It does not say PCR tests are ineffective for detecting viruses.
OffGuardian makes several other inaccurate claims in its article, including:


""There are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19."" The CDC says otherwise.


""The existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is based on faith, not fact."" Several researchers have analyzed the genetic material of the coronavirus — including its RNA.


Between 22% and 77% ""of the ‘positive’ tests are false ‘positives.’"" Currently, about 92% of tests in the United States produce negative results.


RELATED: Coronavirus testing: What we know, all in one place
There are legitimate questions about the accuracy of diagnostic COVID-19 tests, particularly for people who are not experiencing symptoms. There have been several cases of tests producing the wrong results, and some experts are concerned about false-negatives.
But OffGuardian’s claim about PCR tests is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!

<p><em>Last updated 4 p.m. Oct. 16</em></p>
<p>On a crowded debate stage, a dozen Democratic presidential candidates sparred over health care, talked about reining in the excesses of capitalism and debated how to protect workers in an age of technological upheaval. </p>
<p>The evening opened with a volley of questions on impeachment — including President Donald Trump’s attacks on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's ties to Ukraine — then pivoted to a dissection of candidates’ policy differences.</p>
<p>PolitiFact fact-checked several statements made by the candidates at the recent debate in Westerville, Ohio. </p>

<p><em>U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks during the Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by CNN/New York Times at Otterbein University on Oct. 15, 2019, in Westerville, Ohio. (AP)</em></p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Warren draws a line between health insurance and bankruptcy</div>
<p>""Back when I was studying it, two out of three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance."" </p>
<p><em>— Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.</em></p>
<p>In a back-and-forth about Medicare For All and the cost of health care, Warren directed the discussion back to medical debt and bankruptcy — citing her own work from Harvard Law School. Her wording is precise, but the paper itself is controversial. We rated this statement <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/health-check/statements/2019/oct/16/elizabeth-warren/warren-wades-debate-health-care-costs-and-bankrupt/"">Mostly True</a>.</p>
<p>Warren’s campaign directed us to research published in 2009 in the American Journal of Medicine. Co-authored by Warren, it looks at a random sample of 2,314 bankruptcy filers from 2007.</p>
<p>The paper examined what debtors reported as their cause of bankruptcy. Warren is referring here to people who either cited significant direct medical debt, remortgaging a home to pay medical debt, or lost income due to illness.</p>
<p>In that category, more than two-thirds of families had health insurance — in fact, three-quarters did. So from that simple standpoint, the number checks out.</p>
<p>But it isn’t necessarily that simple. This specific paper has long been the subject of controversy. In part, it’s because it focuses on people who have declared bankruptcy, rather than looking at the financial impact of medical debt at large.</p>
<p>What’s more suspect is whether this finding — even if accurate — supports her next point: that the cost of health care is what’s driving people’s financial problems, and that a generous single-payer plan would ameliorate this issue.</p>
<div class=""artembed""><img src=""https://static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/AP_19289013551871_1.jpg""/></div>
<p><em>Former Vice President Joe Biden speaks during the Democratic presidential primary debate at Otterbein University on Oct. 15, 2019, in Westerville, Ohio. (AP)</em></p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Joe Biden’s claim about cost of Medicare for All   </div>
<p>""For people making between $50,000 and $75,000 a year, their taxes are going up about $5,000 because the fact is, they will pay more in new taxes"" for Medicare for All. </p>
<p><em>— Former Vice President Joe Biden</em></p>
<p>This is <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/health-check/statements/2019/oct/16/joe-biden/bidens-claim-medicare-all-tax-hikes-rests-flaky-an/"">Mostly False</a>.</p>
<p>Biden used an unusual level of specificity in describing how Medicare for all would affect families making between $50,000 and $75,000 per year. His numbers don’t come out of thin air, but they are based on too many assumptions to be reliable. </p>
<p>Biden’s campaign told us the figure was derived from approximating the impact of a 4% income tax, plus a 7.5% payroll tax — financing mechanisms they said have been proposed under Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All plan.</p>
<p>When you do the math, that suggests a family making $60,000 would indeed see the tax increase Biden surmised. But this math is problematic on many levels.</p>
<p>For one thing, Sanders’ bill doesn’t actually propose financing Medicare for All through a combined 4% income tax and 7.5% payroll tax. The bill doesn’t include any financing mechanism at all.</p>
<p>Another problem is that highlighting the potential tax burden of Medicare for All without discussing overall costs is misleading.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Julian Castro wrong on manufacturing jobs</div>
<p>""Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them.""</p>
<p><em>— Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/16/julian-castro/julian-castro-wrong-about-job-losses-ohio-michigan/"">False</a>. Official government figures show that each state gained jobs between July 2019 and August 2019, the latest month-over-month period available. To arrive at his job-loss figure, Castro cherry-picked a time period that he didn’t mention in his remarks — a time period that ignores the existence of the most current data.</p>
<p>His assertion that employment levels have been crumbling in these states is belied by data showing that each state has seen job gains both in the past year and since Trump took office. </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Tulsi Gabbard claims the New York Times, CNN called her a Russian asset</div>
<p>""Just two days ago The New York Times put out an article saying I’m a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning a CNN commentator said on national television that I am an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.""</p>
<p><em>— U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii</em></p>
<p>The accuracy of Gabbard’s claim is mixed.  </p>
<p>Let’s start with the New York Times, which co-hosted the debate with CNN. Gabbard appeared to be referring to an Oct. 12 article that carried the headline, ""<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard.html"">What, Exactly, Is Tulsi Gabbard Up To?</a>"" </p>
<p>Political reporter Lisa Lerer’s article characterized Gabbard as injecting chaos in the 2020 race, citing the Hawaii congresswoman’s <a href=""https://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1182282461859811328"">threat</a> to boycott the debate over her claim that Democrats and corporate media are trying to ""rig"" the election.</p>
<p>The article does not explicitly call Gabbard a Russian asset. Rather, it explores why she has garnered support from alt-right and white nationalist activists, and notes that some Democrats ""worry about supportive signs from online bot activity and the Russian news media.""</p>
<p>Gabbard is right that a CNN commentator called her a Russian asset. Bakari Sellers, a former state legislator in South Carolina, <a href=""https://twitter.com/notcapnamerica/status/1184137347832729606"">leveled the charge</a> during an Oct. 15 panel discussion. </p>
<p>""There is a chance that Tulsi is not just working for the United States of America,"" Sellers said, later adding, ""There is no question that Tulsi Gabbard — among all the 12 — is a puppet for the Russian government.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Cory Booker on Planned Parenthood closures in Ohio</div>
<p>""We are in a state that has had two Planned Parenthoods close.""</p>
<p><em>— Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.</em></p>
<p>Booker is right. Two Planned Parenthood clinics, which provide reproductive planning services such as abortion, <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/US/planned-parenthood-announces-closure-clinics-ohio-amidst-stricter/story?id=65483584"">announced they were closing</a> in Cincinnati, Ohio, in early September. Their last day of service was Sept. 20, and <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/09/two-planned-parenthood-clinics-ohio-close-amid-funding-loss/2269213001/"">neither provided</a> abortions.</p>
<p>The move came less than a month after Planned Parenthood <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/health/planned-parenthood-title-x.html"">said it would stop participating</a> in a federal program that supports family planning services. The organization received about $60 million annually through Title X, a federal grant program.</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood pulled out of the program after the Trump administration issued a rule that forbids clinics with Title X funding from referring women to abortion providers. <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/24/patients-face-higher-fees-longer-waits-after-planned-parenthood-quits-federal-program/"">The Washington Post reported</a> that, where the withdrawal didn’t force the closure of health centers, it did result in higher fees and waiting times for some.</p>
<p>There are still 24 Planned Parenthood health centers around Ohio. Five are operated by Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio, where the two locations recently closed.</p>

<p><em>Entrepreneur Andrew Yang speaks during the Oct. 15, 2019, Democratic presidential primary debate in Westerville, Ohio. (AP)</em></p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Andrew Yang on wealth taxes abroad</div>
<p>""A wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle. The problem is it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden and all those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they projected.""</p>
<p><em>— Andrew Yang</em></p>
<p>Yang was responding to Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s proposal to directly tax the wealth of American billionaires. His claim is accurate, but it’s unclear whether the same problems would extend to the United States.</p>
<p>Warren’s Ultra-Millionaire Tax, the first of its kind, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/upshot/warren-wealth-tax.html"">would tax fortunes</a> of more than $50 million at 2% annually. She has touted the proposal as a way to pay for universal childcare and universal college tuition programs, but <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/apr/25/elizabeth-warren-does-her-wealth-tax-pay-her-child/"">we have found reasons</a> to doubt her math.</p>
<p>Yang’s claim about the failure of wealth taxes in Europe is similar to <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2019/may/10/joel-griffith/some-countries-ditched-wealth-taxes-what-might-mea/"">one we fact-checked in April</a>. We rated that claim Mostly True.</p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=REV"">Data</a> from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international body based in Paris, show that 12 or 13 countries collected revenues from net wealth taxes in 1996. (The tally differs slightly based on how you measure it.)</p>
<p>Nine European countries have ended their wealth taxes since then. (Today, six or seven European nations have some form of wealth tax.) And the reason why has to do with how difficult it is to levy them.</p>
<p>A 2015 <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/resources/documents/taxation/gen_info/economic_analysis/tax_papers/taxation_paper_60.pdf"">review of the wealth tax option</a> by the European Commission found that determining the value of people’s assets was difficult and that cheating was easier. <a href=""https://www.oecd.org/publications/the-role-and-design-of-net-wealth-taxes-in-the-oecd-9789264290303-en.htm"">A 2018 report</a> from the OECD said revenues collected from wealth taxes were generally low and that there were several ""efficiency and administrative concerns.""</p>
<p>However, we’ve spoken to experts who say the same thing wouldn’t necessarily happen in the United States. There’s a difference in the overall tax regimes, and OECD analysts said that arguments for and against wealth taxes depend on how other tax laws would work with Warren’s proposal.</p>

<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Tom Steyer on raises</div>
<p>""People haven’t had a raise — 90% of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.""</p>
<p><em>— Tom Steyer</em></p>
<p>This isn’t accurate.</p>
<p>A study by the <a href=""https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2018-11/54646-Distribution_of_Household_Income_2015_0.pdf"">Congressional Budget Office</a>, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, found that between 1979 and 2015, the top 1% of earners did see the fastest gains, but the three other income ranges – the lowest 20%, the middle 60%, the 81st percentile to the 99th percentile – did see gains. (These figures were adjusted for inflation and federal taxes, but not for state and local taxes.)</p>
<p>In April, Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/apr/05/pete-buttigieg/has-income-stalled-bottom-90-1970s-pete-buttigieg-/"">told us</a> that the data since 2015 would likely show additional increases, since incomes across all the income distribution have improved since 2015.</p>
<p>We did find a different statistic that makes Steyer’s claim closer to the mark, though still not accurate. The share of national income taken by the bottom 90 percent has indeed declined since 1973.</p>
<p>The dueling statistics show that people can see their share of the pie decrease yet still receive a raise in absolute terms.</p>

<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Debating Medicare for All</div>
<p>Americans ""say that what they want is a choice"" to join a single-payer system like Medicare rather than ending private insurance.</p>
<p><em>— Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana</em></p>
<p>Buttigieg sparred with Elizabeth Warren over how to expand health insurance coverage for all Americans.</p>
<p>Buttigieg said he favors allowing Americans younger than 65 to enroll in Medicare if they wish. Warren, by contrast, prefers to transition all Americans from their current insurance plan to government coverage.</p>
<p>And Buttigieg said Americans support his approach more than they support Warren’s.</p>
<p>Polls from 2019 bear out his argument.</p>
<p>Notably, a poll <a href=""http://files.kff.org/attachment/Topline-KFF-Health-Tracking-Poll-January-2019"">conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in January 2019</a> found 56% support for a Warren-style plan, with 42% opposed. By contrast, the Buttigieg approach won support from 74% of respondents, compared to opposition from just 24%.</p>
<p>Indeed, Kaiser’s polling <a href=""https://www.kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-october-2019/"">shows</a> a steady rise in support for the Buttigieg approach and a steady decline for Warren’s approach over the course of the year.</p>
<p>We rated the statement <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/16/pete-buttigieg/refereeing-pete-buttigieg-elizabeth-warren-medicar/"">True</a>.</p>

<p>Clinton did say that, but it needs context. It’s worth noting that the line appears to have been publicly <a href=""https://harvardpolitics.com/united-states/safe-legal-and-rare-the-democrats-evolving-stance-on-abortion/"">used first</a> by her husband, President Bill Clinton, in 1996, and adopted by Hilary Clinton when she was First Lady. Also, Clinton appears to have dropped the ""rare"" part of the line in 2016.</p>
<p>""Despite our differences, there are certain core beliefs and values that tie us together and set us apart as Americans,"" she said during <a href=""https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/WH/EOP/First_Lady/html/generalspeeches/1999/19990122.html"">remarks</a> in January 1999 before the abortion rights group NARAL. ""And it is those beliefs that can guide us in reaching our goal of keeping abortion safe, legal and rare into the next century.""</p>
<p>During Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, she took a question from a voter who asked how she would bridge the divide on abortion. Clinton <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N69e-hmmy14"">replied</a> that her longstanding position is that ""abortion should be safe, legal and rare — and by ‘rare,’ I mean rare.""</p>
<p>She dropped the word ""rare"" from her policy pronouncements when she ran for president again in 2016 during an <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-hillary-clinton-sen-marco-rubio-donald/story?id=36760228"">interview</a>: ""You know, I've been on record for many years about where I stand on abortion, how it should be safe and legal, and I have the same position that I've had for a very long time.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Biden speaks on son’s work in Ukraine</div>
<p>""I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We've always kept everything separate.""</p>
<p><em>— Former Vice President Joe Biden</em></p>
<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden’s claim slightly contradicts what Hunter Biden said during a new interview with <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-hiding-plain-sight-hunter-biden-defends-foreign/story?id=66275416"">ABC News</a>, when he confirmed reporting from <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign"">the New Yorker</a> that the two had shared one brief exchange about his work for Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas company.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden told <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign"">the New Yorker</a> that his father briefly mentioned his work with Burisma only once. Here’s how the younger Biden characterized the conversation to the New Yorker: ""Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do.’""</p>
<p>Still, it’s not clear that the two ever spoke at length about the matter. When ABC’s Amy Robach <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-hiding-plain-sight-hunter-biden-defends-foreign/story?id=66275416"">asked</a> Hunter Biden if he and his father had ever discussed Ukraine, the younger Biden said their one chat didn’t amount to a full-fledged discussion. </p>
<p>""As I said, the only time was after a news account, and it wasn’t a discussion in any way,"" he said. ""There’s no but to this. No. We never did.""</p>
<p>Robach then asked specifically about his quote in the New Yorker story, and Biden confirmed that the quote was accurate: ""I said, ‘I do,’ and that was literally the end of our discussion.""</p>

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<p>President Donald Trump repeated several false or misleading claims as he justified the need for a national emergency declaration to secure funding for a border wall.</p>
<p>Trump, who had not released the scope of his executive action as of mid-day Feb. 15, repeatedly said a wall was the best way to stop the flow of drugs, gang members and human trafficking across the border. He labeled any facts that might undercut his argument, ""just a lie.""</p>
<p>We looked at the official numbers and found otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>""So I'm going to be signing a national emergency and it's been signed many times before. It's been signed by other presidents from 1977 or so, it gave the presidents the power. There's rarely been a problem. They sign it. Nobody cares.""</strong></p>
<p>National emergency declarations are signed relatively frequently by presidents, but Trump downplays the political implications of his move.</p>
<p>Many immigration experts and lawmakers question the existence of the crisis that Trump says justifies his declaration.</p>
<p>The National Emergencies Act of 1976 allows presidents to declare national emergencies. President can issue their own national emergency declaration and renew declarations from past presidents that have not expired.</p>
<p>A Brennan Center <a href=""https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/NEA%20Declarations.pdf"">database</a> says there’s been at least 58 national emergency declarations since November 1979; 31 still in effect. They often deal with situations related to foreign governments and foreign entities and rely on powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.</p>
<p>Immigration experts say the crisis at the border is tied to an overwhelmed immigration court system. The number of people apprehended at the border is far below the numbers in the 2000s.</p>

<p><strong>""A big majority of the big drugs, the big drug loads don't go through ports of entry. They can't go through ports of entry.""</strong></p>
<p>Trump’s own government data <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2019/jan/14/nita-lowey/majority-opioids-come-us-through-points-entry-lowe/"">undercut</a> his claim.</p>
<p>Trump said he got his numbers from the Homeland Security Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is part of Homeland Security, <a href=""https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-statistics"">reports that most of the drugs come through ports of entry</a>.</p>
<p>CPB’s Office of Field Operations, working at ports of entry, seized 4,813 pounds of heroin during the first 11 months of fiscal year 2018, through Aug. 31, 2018. During the same period, U.S. Border Patrol, which works between legal ports of entry, seized 532 pounds of heroin.</p>
<p>The data also show that fentanyl, another opioid, was seized at ports of entry at a higher rate than at points between ports of entry. CBP recently intercepted a record amount of fentanyl worth $4.6 million <a href=""https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/cbp-officers-seize-largest-amount-fentanyl-cbp-history"">at the Port of Nogales</a>.</p>
<p>Information has its limits. The <a href=""https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffas.org%2Fsgp%2Fcrs%2Fmisc%2FR44599.pdf&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cplakamp%40buffnews.com%7Cc347669abea94e06bc2708d677f7f55f%7C58e1e377c42b4bde81b137cdd1cf59c7%7C0%7C0%7C636828304187812817&amp;sdata=l6myPf%2FTmW9VRhNptpuKwX%2FvLQd6KKrWx%2B2%2BeGiAxbY%3D&amp;reserved=0"">Congressional Research Service</a> warned in December that ""data on seizures are available, but these reflect an unknown portion of total drugs traversing U.S. borders.""</p>
<p><em>— Jon Greenberg</em></p>
<p><strong>In China, ""a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty. Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called, how about a fine?""</strong></p>
<p>China does have a <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-china-singapore-have-death-penal/"">death penalty for drug dealers</a>: Chinese law says that individuals who smuggle, traffic, transport or manufacture drugs and meet certain conditions can receive a death sentence.</p>
<p>But Trump exaggerated the usual penalty for a U.S. drug dealer. In the federal justice system — which Trump’s administration directly controls — most offenders are sent to prison.</p>
<p>Data from the <a href=""https://www.ussc.gov/research/data-reports/geography/2017-federal-sentencing-statistics"">U.S. Sentencing Commission</a> shows that in fiscal year 2017, more than 95 percent of about 18,000 individuals sentenced in federal drug-trafficking cases got a prison sentence. Less than 3 percent received only probation. And 80.4 percent of those sentenced for simple possession got prison time, said Julie Samuels, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.</p>
<p>Though comprehensive state-level statistics are scarce, the likelihood of convicts avoiding a prison sentence are higher for state-level prosecutions, ranging between 30 percent and 60 percent, said Michael Tonry, a University of Minnesota Law School professor. Sentencing varies widely depending on the substance sold, the quantity, the jurisdiction, and the defendant’s record, he said.</p>
<p>In addition, Trump was misleading when he suggested that a fine by itself is likely, experts said. Those who do get a fine rather than prison typically get sentenced to probation as well.</p>

<p><strong>""We may be using one of the national emergencies that (President Barack Obama) signed having to do with cartels, criminal cartels. It's a very good emergency he signed, and we are going to use parts of it in our dealings on cartels.""</strong></p>
<p>Obama did use emergency powers to freeze the financial assets of four foreign criminal operations, but it’s unclear how that would help build a wall.</p>
<p>On <a href=""https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/07/25/executive-order-13581-blocking-property-transnational-criminal-organizat"">July 25, 2011</a>, Obama announced that ""significant transnational criminal organizations constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.""</p>
<p>Obama targeted four groups, including Mexico’s Los Zetas criminal network, a Russian group called The Brothers, Camorra operating out of Italy and Japan’s Yakuza.</p>
<p>The order blocked the sale or transfer of any U.S. asset linked to these groups. In July 2017, <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/notice-regarding-continuation-national-emergency-respect-transnational-criminal-organizations/"">Trump extended Obama’s order</a> for another year.</p>
<p><em>— Jon Greenberg</em></p>
<p><strong>""You have chain migration. Where a bad person comes in, brings 22 or 23 or 35 of his family members because he has his mother, his grandmother, sister, cousin, uncle. They are all in. You know what happened on the west side highway. That young wise guy drove over and killed eight people. … He had many people brought in because he was in the United States.""</strong></p>
<p>This is <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/24/donald-trump/donald-trumps-unsubstantiated-claims-about-chain-m/"">unproven</a>. Sayfullo Saipov, the Uzbekistan-born suspect on trial for the 2017 truck attack in New York, entered the United States in 2010 through the lottery program. As a green card holder, he could only petition for a spouse and unmarried children to come to the United States. Media reports indicate that Saipov married a woman who already lived in the United States and that their three children were born in the United States.</p>
<p>Trump’s broader criticism of chain migration is <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/31/donald-trump/donald-trumps-misleading-claim-about-chain-migrati/"">exaggerated</a>. Theoretically, one immigrant’s arrival in the United States could lead to the immigration of an aunt or uncle — if the first immigrant becomes a U.S. citizen and petitioned a parent, that parent could eventually become a U.S. citizen and petition his or her siblings.</p>
<p>But no one can directly petition an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent.</p>
<p><em>— Katie Sanders</em></p>
<p><strong>""And then you have the lottery — it’s a horror show. Because when countries put people into the lottery, they’re not putting you in. They’re putting some very bad people in the lottery. It’s common sense.""</strong></p>
<p>Trump’s criticism is rooted in the fact that Saipov entered the United States through the lottery program in 2010. But this is a <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/20/donald-trump/pick-them-bin-donald-trump-mischaracterizes-divers/"">Pants on Fire</a> distortion about how the diversity visa lottery system works.</p>
<p>Countries don't send immigrants to the U.S. lottery. The lottery is administered by the United States, not foreign governments. Applicants are randomly selected, but they must meet education and work requirements to be eligible. Those who make it to the visa application process <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/02/sarah-huckabee-sanders/white-house-press-secretary-claims-diversity-visa-/"">are vetted</a> with background checks and security screenings.</p>
<p><em>— Katie Sanders</em></p>
<p><strong>""We will have a national emergency, and we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit, even though it shouldn’t be there.""</strong></p>
<p>Here’s why we can expect lawsuits challenging the emergency order reaching the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, once lower courts have made their rulings: A large chunk of the U.S.-Mexico border falls within the <a href=""https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000135"">circuit’s jurisdiction</a>, specifically the <a href=""https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000135"">27 percent of the border</a> that’s in California and Arizona.</p>
<p>""Arizona and California would be appropriate venues for challenges pursued by the states and private landowners, and appeals from those district court decisions would go to the Ninth Circuit,"" said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond.</p>

<p><em>— Louis Jacobson</em></p>
<p><strong>""President Obama put more debt on this country than any president in the history of our country combined.""</strong></p>
<p>More debt did accumulate under Obama than all of his predecessors combined, though the biggest reasons for the increase predated Obama.</p>
<p>According to Treasury Department <a href=""https://treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/search?startMonth=01&amp;startDay=20&amp;startYear=2009&amp;endMonth=01&amp;endDay=20&amp;endYear=2017"">data</a>, Obama entered office with $6.3 trillion in public debt. By the time he left office on Jan. 20, 2017, the public debt had risen to $14.4 trillion — an increase of $8.1 trillion.</p>
<p>Much of the debt increase stems from spending programs like Social Security and Medicare, which are effectively on autopilot and are now paying for a rising number of aging Americans.</p>
<p>If Trump serves eight years, it will eventually be his time in the barrel: Unless and until the United States reverses course and starts paying down the debt, every new president is expected to preside over ever-larger amounts of debt.</p>
<p><em>— Louis Jacobson</em></p>
<p><strong>""I believe (Obama) would have gone to war with North Korea. I think he was ready to go to war.""</strong></p>
<p>We asked a range of North Korea and foreign-policy experts whether they thought it was likely, or even plausible, that the United States was on the precipice of war with North Korea during Obama’s tenure.</p>
<p>Universally, the experts we contacted <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/feb/18/was-us-brink-war-north-korea-trump-review-evidence/"">said no</a>.</p>
<p>The overall policy toward North Korea during Obama’s tenure was ""strategic patience"" — the notion that ""if we ignore them, they will go away and eventually implode,"" said John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org.</p>
<p>There’s room for disagreement about how effective ""strategic patience"" was. But it was ""not the same thing as preparing for war, or planning a war, or even intending to conduct a war,"" said Joseph DeThomas, a professor at the Penn State School of International Affairs. ""Obama was doing none of those. He was upgrading military deployments in order to deter North Korea and to reassure allies.""</p>
<p>In fact, ""in pointing the finger of blame at Obama, Trump is seeking to distract us from the fact that he was playing both the arsonist and the fireman in stoking the flames of war and then riding to the ‘rescue’ in the form of his bromance with Kim,"" said Evans J.R. Revere, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution and a senior director with the Albright Stonebridge Group. ""It has made for great theater, even if it has done nothing to rid us of the North Korean nuclear and missile threat.""</p>

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>In his inaugural address, President Donald Trump painted a picture of a nation that has steadily marched down the wrong path.</p>
<p>""We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon,"" he said. ""One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.""</p>
<p>Trump vowed to end this ""American carnage.""</p>
<p>It’s tough to measure strength and confidence, but there are ways to measure wealth. We decided to look at whether America’s wealth has fallen while other countries became rich.</p>
<p>Trump’s office told us he was thinking about America’s $800 billion trade deficit. However, trade deficits are not a measure of national or household wealth. There is no question that trade with China has cost America jobs to the benefit of Chinese workers. But again, Trump said we made other countries rich while our wealth faded and that’s a different point.</p>
<p>Economists measure the wealth of nations in two ways. They look at the size of their economies, the GDP, and they look at how well the average citizen is doing, or GDP per capita.</p>
<p>Through either lens, the wealth of the United States has not dissipated.  </p>
<p>This chart comes from <a href=""https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_"">International Monetary Fund data</a>. With its $18 trillion economy, the United States is a good one-third wealthier than its closest economic rival, China.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>China’s economy avoided the dip that the United States faced in the Great Recession, and it has grown at a faster rate, but America remains the wealthiest nation.</p>
<p>Seen through the lens of GDP per capita (and factoring in the purchasing power of each currency), the United States looks even better compared to China, a country Trump often points to as the source of America’s woes.</p>
<div class=""artembed""><a id=""see-figure-2-on-politifactcom""></a><iframe frameborder=""0"" height=""325"" marginheight=""0"" marginwidth=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.google.com/publicdata/embed?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ppppc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=country:US:CN:JP:IN:DE&amp;ifdim=world&amp;tstart=317192400000&amp;tend=1421730000000&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en_US&amp;ind=false"" width=""400""></iframe></div>
<p>China ranks 83rd in the world on a per capita basis because while its economy is huge, it has about 1.3 billion people, many of whom are very poor.</p>
<p>There is one way to look at the shifting economic fortunes of the typical adult that does express a sense of what Trump described.</p>
<p>The international bank Credit Suisse has calculated adult wealth since 2000. Using their <a href=""http://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/index.cfm?fileid=AD6F2B43-B17B-345E-E20A1A254A3E24A5"">2016 data</a>, we find that the median wealth rose in each of the largest economies, including the United States, but it rose nearly three times faster in China than it did in the United States.</p>
<div class=""artembed""><a id=""see-figure-3-on-politifactcom""></a><div class=""infogram-embed"" data-id=""3b54eb8b-2a27-4eb1-a61d-b94f54a24382"" data-title=""Median adult wealth"" data-type=""interactive""></div><script>!function(e,t,n,s){var i=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t),d=o[0],a=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(s)&&(s=a+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var r=e.createElement(t);r.async=1,r.id=n,r.src=s,d.parentNode.insertBefore(r,d)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");</script></div>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>Trump said that other countries became rich while the wealth of America ""dissipated."" Based on the most common measures of national wealth, that is inaccurate.

</div>]","In his inaugural address, President Donald Trump painted a picture of a nation that has steadily marched down the wrong path.
""We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon,"" he said. ""One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.""
Trump vowed to end this ""American carnage.""
It’s tough to measure strength and confidence, but there are ways to measure wealth. We decided to look at whether America’s wealth has fallen while other countries became rich.
Trump’s office told us he was thinking about America’s $800 billion trade deficit. However, trade deficits are not a measure of national or household wealth. There is no question that trade with China has cost America jobs to the benefit of Chinese workers. But again, Trump said we made other countries rich while our wealth faded and that’s a different point.
Economists measure the wealth of nations in two ways. They look at the size of their economies, the GDP, and they look at how well the average citizen is doing, or GDP per capita.
Through either lens, the wealth of the United States has not dissipated.  
This chart comes from International Monetary Fund data. With its $18 trillion economy, the United States is a good one-third wealthier than its closest economic rival, China.

People are participating in “National Rape Day’” on April 24.












By Gabrielle Settles • April 24, 2023








China’s economy avoided the dip that the United States faced in the Great Recession, and it has grown at a faster rate, but America remains the wealthiest nation.
Seen through the lens of GDP per capita (and factoring in the purchasing power of each currency), the United States looks even better compared to China, a country Trump often points to as the source of America’s woes.

China ranks 83rd in the world on a per capita basis because while its economy is huge, it has about 1.3 billion people, many of whom are very poor.
There is one way to look at the shifting economic fortunes of the typical adult that does express a sense of what Trump described.
The international bank Credit Suisse has calculated adult wealth since 2000. Using their 2016 data, we find that the median wealth rose in each of the largest economies, including the United States, but it rose nearly three times faster in China than it did in the United States.

Trump said that other countries became rich while the wealth of America ""dissipated."" Based on the most common measures of national wealth, that is inaccurate. The United States has the world’s largest economy and, when averaged across the population, the typical American does better than the people of any other country.
There is some argument to be made that the typcial Chinese worker's wealth has gone up much faster than the typical American's, but the American is still much wealthier.

<html><body><p>The coronavirus pandemic has generated a torrent of <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/jan/24/fact-checking-hoaxes-and-conspiracies-about-corona/"">conspiracy theories</a>. One of them is that the U.S. government somehow planned the pandemic.</p>
<p>An April 26 <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156921524050178&amp;set=a.10153704556055178&amp;type=3"">Facebook post</a> sought to prove its case by showing a screenshot of a Wikipedia-like page describing the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, more commonly known as the CARES Act. </p>
<p>The $2.2 trillion act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, included direct payments to most Americans, enhanced unemployment aid, loans for small business and other relief measures.</p>
<p>The page captured in the screenshot lists the bill as having been introduced on Jan. 24, 2017. That’s more than three years before the novel coronavirus was declared a pandemic, which the post cites as evidence that the pandemic was a long-planned event.</p>
<p>The poster added the comment, ""Clearly a PLAN-DEMIC. Guess what they have planned next for you. Hint — None of it is in your best interest. Hint 2 — It's much worse than you could ever imagine.""</p>
<p>This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related"">partnership with Facebook</a>.) </p>

<p>While the Democratic House majority did offer a version of the bill, negotiators from the White House and the Senate were already deep into talks about what should be in the bill. When the Senate came up with a version of the bill that the leaders in both parties could support, they drew up the legislative text to be voted on.</p>
<p>However, because of the constitutional rule on tax-related bills, the senators didn’t create a new Senate bill. Instead, they took an existing bill that had been passed by the House but not by the Senate. The Senate stripped out the language, inserted the new CARES Act wording into the shell, and voted on it.

<p>What the Senate did is a ""commonly used workaround,"" said Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist who specializes in legislative procedure.</p>
<p>The original House bill had been to repeal the ""Cadillac tax"" on high-cost insurance plans, which was part of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. It was introduced on Jan. 24, 2019, (not 2017, as the image in the post says) and easily <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/actions?KWICView=false"">passed the House on July 17, 2019</a>, 419-6.</p>
<p>The bill never made it to a vote in the Senate, making the measure ripe for the picking when Senate leaders went looking for a House-passed measure where the CARES Act language could be swapped in.

<p>This <a href=""https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/494661-covid-19-the-week-that-was-in-congress"">same tactic was used </a>in the subsequent coronavirus response bill that added more funding for small-business loans, said Donald R.

</div>]","The coronavirus pandemic has generated a torrent of conspiracy theories. One of them is that the U.S. government somehow planned the pandemic.
An April 26 Facebook post sought to prove its case by showing a screenshot of a Wikipedia-like page describing the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, more commonly known as the CARES Act. 
The $2.2 trillion act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, included direct payments to most Americans, enhanced unemployment aid, loans for small business and other relief measures.
The page captured in the screenshot lists the bill as having been introduced on Jan. 24, 2017. That’s more than three years before the novel coronavirus was declared a pandemic, which the post cites as evidence that the pandemic was a long-planned event.
The poster added the comment, ""Clearly a PLAN-DEMIC. Guess what they have planned next for you. Hint — None of it is in your best interest. Hint 2 — It's much worse than you could ever imagine.""
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
In reality, there’s a mundane explanation for why the bill was introduced well before the pandemic itself, and it has nothing to do with a government plot. But explaining it requires a short lesson in constitutional law and how Congress works.
Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution says that bills related to raising revenue must originate in the House of Representatives before moving to the Senate for consideration.
Sometimes, lawmakers decide that revenue-related legislation must pass urgently, and the shortest path is to skip the normal House-to-Senate process.
That was the case with the CARES Act.

Facebook posts said the government must have planned the coronavirus pandemic because the coronavirus relief bill had been introduced three years earlier.
The introduction date cited in the post was off by two years, and the post is a misunderstanding of how the bill moved through Congress. 
Because of a constitutional requirement that tax-related bills originate in the House, the senators who drew up the CARES Act used a common workaround, stripping an existing House-passed bill of its old text and inserting the new text into it. 
So there’s nothing fishy about a coronavirus relief bill having been introduced prior to the pandemic’s emergence. The original text of the bill that eventually became the CARES Act was on an entirely different topic.

<html><body><p>Fox News host Tucker Carlson promoted a number of false, misleading and unsubstantiated claims about election fraud in Georgia in a recent segment on his cable news program.</p>
<p>""It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia, last November,"" Carlson <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210915165338/https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/tucker-investigates-fulton-county-election-incident"">said July 14</a>. ""That is not a conspiracy theory. It's true.""</p>
<p>Carlson told his viewers he was giving them the ""fact-based,"" ""official version"" of what happened in Georgia, where Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump by more than 11,000 votes in a contest the state’s Republican election officials <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210915165338/https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/jan/05/heres-why-georgias-republican-officials-are-confid/"">affirmed</a> was free and fair. </p>
<p>But Carlson’s account of what happened in Fulton County — a Democratic stronghold that includes Atlanta — was neither official nor true. State and local officials and election experts said his claim of fraud reflected a misunderstanding of election procedures.</p>
<p>""Nothing that he brought up points to any voter fraud,"" Richard Barron, Fulton County’s elections director, told PolitiFact.</p>
<p>Viral clips from the segment online were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210915165338/https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related"">partnership with Facebook</a>.) </p>
<p>In the past, Fox News has <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210915165338/https://www.npr.org/2020/09/29/917747123/you-literally-cant-believe-the-facts-tucker-carlson-tells-you-so-say-fox-s-lawye"">argued</a> in court that Carlson’s show should not always be viewed as strictly factual, and that his viewers expect him to stray from the truth. Asked about the July 14 segment, a Fox News spokesperson pointed as evidence not to any official record or finding, but to a <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210915165338/https://voterga.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Press-Release-New-Evidence-Reveals-Georgia-Audit-Fraud-and-Massive-Errors.pdf"">July 13 press release</a> from VoterGA, a group Carlson cited during his segment. </p>
<p>The group, led by Garland Favorito, is leading a search for evidence of fraud with a lawsuit seeking access to Fulton County’s absentee ballots. A critic of Georgia’s elections, Favorito <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210915165338/https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/06/01/fulton-county-investigating-alarm-at-election-warehouse-conspiracy-theories-grow"">has promoted</a> conspiracy theories about 9/11, John F.

<p><em>Supports of President Donald Trump holds signs outside State Farm Arena on Nov. 5, 2020, in Atlanta. (AP)</em></p>
<p>Here’s the truth behind the main claims Carlson made on air.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">A warehouse alarm</div>
<p>Carlson opened his segment with a dramatic — and misleading — story about an alarm that went off at a warehouse housing ballots in Fulton County this year: </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;"">""On a Saturday night in late May of this year, an alarm sounded in a big, nondescript warehouse in Fulton County, Georgia. The warehouse was an unlikely place for a burglary … But someone tried to do it anyway, and at just the perfect moment, 20 minutes after deputies in charge of guarding the warehouse left their post. By the time those deputies returned to check out the alarm, someone had opened the hundred-pound door to the warehouse. So what happened that night? And why? We still don’t know.""</p>
<p>We do know. In fact, a photograph Carlson aired on screen <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210915165338/https://twitter.com/stphnfwlr/status/1415665393306382336?s=20"">came</a> from a Georgia Public Broadcasting <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210915165338/https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/06/01/fulton-county-investigating-alarm-at-election-warehouse-conspiracy-theories-grow"">report</a> that explained what happened.</p>
<p><img src=""https://static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/Screen_Shot_2021-07-20_at_3.53.39_PM.png""/></p>
<p><em>A screenshot of a ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" segment about alleged voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia, as seen on July 14, 2021.</em></p>
<p>The alarm that rang did not come from the part of the building housing ballots, reporter Stephen Fowler <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210915165338/https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/06/01/fulton-county-investigating-alarm-at-election-warehouse-conspiracy-theories-grow"">wrote in June</a>. And the door was opened by off-duty police officers.</p>
<p>The kicker: The officers who opened it had been hired as private security by an attorney representing several plaintiffs in the lawsuit seeking access to Fulton County’s ballots — the very people seeking to prove Georgia’s election was marred by fraud.</p>
<p>Barron, the elections director, said the alarm was tied to a motion detector in an office belonging to the clerk of the superior court, likely triggered by a rodent. </p>
<p>When it sounded, the Fulton County Sheriff’s deputies watching the building were changing shifts, he said. That left an opening for the litigants’ hired security to approach the building.</p>
<p>Barron said that the county clerk had accidentally left a door unlocked, and that those officers had ""illegally trespassed"" when they opened it and entered. He said they ""staged photos to make it look as though the door was wide open."" </p>
<p>The ballots inside remained secured. </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Double-scanned ballots</div>
<p>Carlson’s second allegation: that Fulton County counted thousands of ballots more than once. </p>
<p>Carlson said VoterGA identified more than 4,000 votes that were duplicates in Fulton County. He also cited an <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210915165338/https://www.ajc.com/politics/some-ballots-initially-double-counted-in-fulton-before-recount/GY4FTEEI6REIJN3SDKIDNIOYV4/"">Atlanta Journal-Constitution report</a> about potential double-scanned ballots in the initial count.</p>
<p>""The final tally from the double counts we know about amounts to more than 3,300 votes for Joe Biden and 865 votes for Donald Trump,"" Carlson said. He added: ""We're talking about a lot of ballots, at least hundreds of ballots involved, enough potentially to affect the outcome of the election.""</p>
<p>Election workers do sometimes make errors, and Fulton County has had a history of messy elections, said Charles S. Bullock III, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia. But a similar claim that over 4,000 of the county’s ballots were scanned multiple times was <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210915165338/https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/19/facebook-posts/no-proof-thousands-double-counted-ballots-2020-pre/"">rated False by PolitiFact</a>. </p>
<p>""There is no evidence that thousands of ballots were counted twice,"" said Amber McReynolds, chief executive officer of the National Vote at Home Institute.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210915165338/https://www.ajc.com/politics/some-ballots-initially-double-counted-in-fulton-before-recount/GY4FTEEI6REIJN3SDKIDNIOYV4/"">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a> reported that the county may have scanned nearly 200 ballots twice before the state’s recounts. But the newspaper added that ""there’s no indication any vote for president was counted more than once in official results.""</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>Georgia conducted a hand audit and a machine recount of ballots, both of which upheld Biden’s victory. For a ballot to have counted twice in the official results, it would have had to be scanned twice in the initial tally, then counted twice again during the hand audit and machine recount.</p>

<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Falsified audit tally sheets</div>
<p>Carlson claimed that VoterGA had found ""falsified"" audit tally sheets with ""fabricated vote totals,"" including sheets that logged hundreds of votes for Biden and zero for other candidates.</p>
<p>""It certainly sounds like flat-out criminal fraud,"" he said.</p>
<p>The source for the claim, again, was VoterGA’s <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210915165338/https://voterga.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Press-Release-New-Evidence-Reveals-Georgia-Audit-Fraud-and-Massive-Errors.pdf"">July 13 press release</a>.

<p>As for the sheets VoterGA said only tallied votes for Biden, Barron said they were likely the result of election workers sorting ballots by candidate during the audit. </p>

<div class=""pf_subheadline"">35,000 voters moved</div>
<p>Carlson's final claim was that thousands of Georgia voters cast ballots from old addresses.</p>
<p>""Nearly 35,000 Georgia voters moved out of their county of residence more than a month prior to Election Day,"" Carlson said. ""They were ineligible to vote. And yet they did.""</p>
<p>The source for Carlson’s claim was an <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210915165338/https://archive.is/yhXqz#selection-403.0-406.0"">article</a> from the Federalist, a conservative website. The article said the figure came from an expert who compared the U.S. Postal Service’s national change-of-address database with data from Georgia’s secretary of state.</p>
<p>The secretary of state’s office told PolitiFact it disputed the claim. And an address change for the purpose of receiving mail <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210915165338/https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/11/matt-schlapp/matt-schlapps-baseless-claim-9000-nevada-mail-ball/?wpmobileexternal=true&amp;wpmobileexternal=true"">is not itself proof of a change in residency</a> that would affect voting. </p>
<p>Some college students might continue to vote from their home address while they go to school, Bullock said. Military members stationed at one of Georgia’s many bases could do the same.</p>
<p>The Federalist’s article acknowledged what Carlson did not — that those people ""may have been students, members of the military, or may have only relocated temporarily.""</p>

<p>Carlson said, ""It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia last November. That is not a conspiracy theory. It's true.""</p>

</article>
</section>
</div>]","Fox News host Tucker Carlson promoted a number of false, misleading and unsubstantiated claims about election fraud in Georgia in a recent segment on his cable news program.
""It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia, last November,"" Carlson said July 14. ""That is not a conspiracy theory. It's true.""
Carlson told his viewers he was giving them the ""fact-based,"" ""official version"" of what happened in Georgia, where Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump by more than 11,000 votes in a contest the state’s Republican election officials affirmed was free and fair. 
But Carlson’s account of what happened in Fulton County — a Democratic stronghold that includes Atlanta — was neither official nor true. State and local officials and election experts said his claim of fraud reflected a misunderstanding of election procedures.
""Nothing that he brought up points to any voter fraud,"" Richard Barron, Fulton County’s elections director, told PolitiFact.
Viral clips from the segment online were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
In the past, Fox News has argued in court that Carlson’s show should not always be viewed as strictly factual, and that his viewers expect him to stray from the truth. Asked about the July 14 segment, a Fox News spokesperson pointed as evidence not to any official record or finding, but to a July 13 press release from VoterGA, a group Carlson cited during his segment. 
The group, led by Garland Favorito, is leading a search for evidence of fraud with a lawsuit seeking access to Fulton County’s absentee ballots. A critic of Georgia’s elections, Favorito has promoted conspiracy theories about 9/11, John F. Kennedy and other topics.

Here’s the truth behind the main claims Carlson made on air.
A warehouse alarm
Carlson opened his segment with a dramatic — and misleading — story about an alarm that went off at a warehouse housing ballots in Fulton County this year: 
""On a Saturday night in late May of this year, an alarm sounded in a big, nondescript warehouse in Fulton County, Georgia. The warehouse was an unlikely place for a burglary … But someone tried to do it anyway, and at just the perfect moment, 20 minutes after deputies in charge of guarding the warehouse left their post. By the time those deputies returned to check out the alarm, someone had opened the hundred-pound door to the warehouse. So what happened that night? And why? We still don’t know.""
We do know. In fact, a photograph Carlson aired on screen came from a Georgia Public Broadcasting report that explained what happened.

A screenshot of a ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" segment about alleged voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia, as seen on July 14, 2021.
The alarm that rang did not come from the part of the building housing ballots, reporter Stephen Fowler wrote in June. And the door was opened by off-duty police officers.
The kicker: The officers who opened it had been hired as private security by an attorney representing several plaintiffs in the lawsuit seeking access to Fulton County’s ballots — the very people seeking to prove Georgia’s election was marred by fraud.
Barron, the elections director, said the alarm was tied to a motion detector in an office belonging to the clerk of the superior court, likely triggered by a rodent. 
When it sounded, the Fulton County Sheriff’s deputies watching the building were changing shifts, he said. That left an opening for the litigants’ hired security to approach the building.
Barron said that the county clerk had accidentally left a door unlocked, and that those officers had ""illegally trespassed"" when they opened it and entered. He said they ""staged photos to make it look as though the door was wide open."" 
The ballots inside remained secured. 
Double-scanned ballots
Carlson’s second allegation: that Fulton County counted thousands of ballots more than once. 
Carlson said VoterGA identified more than 4,000 votes that were duplicates in Fulton County. He also cited an Atlanta Journal-Constitution report about potential double-scanned ballots in the initial count.
""The final tally from the double counts we know about amounts to more than 3,300 votes for Joe Biden and 865 votes for Donald Trump,"" Carlson said. He added: ""We're talking about a lot of ballots, at least hundreds of ballots involved, enough potentially to affect the outcome of the election.""
Election workers do sometimes make errors, and Fulton County has had a history of messy elections, said Charles S. Bullock III, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia. But a similar claim that over 4,000 of the county’s ballots were scanned multiple times was rated False by PolitiFact. 
""There is no evidence that thousands of ballots were counted twice,"" said Amber McReynolds, chief executive officer of the National Vote at Home Institute.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the county may have scanned nearly 200 ballots twice before the state’s recounts. But the newspaper added that ""there’s no indication any vote for president was counted more than once in official results.""

Georgia conducted a hand audit and a machine recount of ballots, both of which upheld Biden’s victory. For a ballot to have counted twice in the official results, it would have had to be scanned twice in the initial tally, then counted twice again during the hand audit and machine recount.
""The chance that you are going to double scan the same batch again is, like you might as well win the lottery,"" Barron said. ""I think the odds are worse.""

On screen, Carlson showed a video of an election worker feeding ballots through a machine and said it ""appears to show large numbers of ballots being scanned multiple times.""
But it’s typical for election workers to have to cancel and rescan some batches of ballots, experts said. The practice is not fraudulent double-counting. It’s what election workers in Fulton County and elsewhere are instructed to do when machines jam up or fail to scan a ballot.
Investigators looked into allegations of fraud in Fulton County and found nothing, the Georgia secretary of state’s office told PolitiFact. The recounts corrected some mistakes that had no bearing on the outcome, including in two counties that went for Trump.
""There’s never been an election held in Georgia which has been checked so many different ways,"" said Bullock. 
Falsified audit tally sheets
Carlson claimed that VoterGA had found ""falsified"" audit tally sheets with ""fabricated vote totals,"" including sheets that logged hundreds of votes for Biden and zero for other candidates.
""It certainly sounds like flat-out criminal fraud,"" he said.
The source for the claim, again, was VoterGA’s July 13 press release. PolitiFact reached out to the group for more details and did not hear back in time for publication.
But the hand audit in which these tally sheets were used did not produce Georgia’s final, certified results, Barron said. The state’s machine recount did, and it confirmed Biden’s victory.
As for the sheets VoterGA said only tallied votes for Biden, Barron said they were likely the result of election workers sorting ballots by candidate during the audit. 
""They would put these into piles, and then on the tally sheet, they would mark the number of votes cast according to the count of each of those piles,"" Barron said.
A photo from the audit shows an election worker doing just that, as USA Today reported. The outlet also reported that there were similar batches from the audit with all votes tallied for Trump. ""Since they did use the sorting method during the recount, it is possible for a batch to look like that,"" McReynolds told PolitiFact.

Ballots without creases
Carlson said a ""whistleblower"" had captured photos of mail-in ballots without creases. 
""That's strange because of course mail-in ballots need to be bent in order to be mailed in,"" he said as the images ran on screen. ""These ballots clearly had never been inside an envelope.""
But many military and overseas voters receive electronic ballots that they print, fill out and return by mail, Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, told the New York Times in January. These ballots are not the right size for scanners, so election workers under supervision transfer those votes onto normal ballots so the scanners can read them.
The same process occurs for ballots that get torn in the scanner, sliced when opening the envelope, or too wrinkled and bent in the mail. During the 2020 election, the process was also standard procedure in Georgia’s Republican counties, CNN’s Daniel Dale reported.
""It is absolutely not proof of fraud,"" McReynolds said.

35,000 voters moved
Carlson's final claim was that thousands of Georgia voters cast ballots from old addresses.
""Nearly 35,000 Georgia voters moved out of their county of residence more than a month prior to Election Day,"" Carlson said. ""They were ineligible to vote. And yet they did.""
The source for Carlson’s claim was an article from the Federalist, a conservative website. The article said the figure came from an expert who compared the U.S. Postal Service’s national change-of-address database with data from Georgia’s secretary of state.
The secretary of state’s office told PolitiFact it disputed the claim. And an address change for the purpose of receiving mail is not itself proof of a change in residency that would affect voting. 
Some college students might continue to vote from their home address while they go to school, Bullock said. Military members stationed at one of Georgia’s many bases could do the same.
The Federalist’s article acknowledged what Carlson did not — that those people ""may have been students, members of the military, or may have only relocated temporarily.""
",PolitiFact,"
Carlson said, ""It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia last November. That is not a conspiracy theory. It's true.""
To back his claim, the Fox News host rattled off several claims purporting to show signs of fraud. Each was inaccurate, misleading or unsubstantiated, PolitiFact found.
Biden’s victory in Georgia was confirmed by two recounts.
We rate Carlson’s claim False.

Ohio TV ad misleads in attack on Mike DeWine about immigration

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>A TV ad portrays Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, a Republican candidate for governor, as out of step with President Donald Trump on immigration.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.onwardohio.org/"">Onward Ohio</a>, a political action committee, launched a <a href=""https://twitter.com/MediumBuying/status/976090612092100608"">statewide TV ad</a> on March 20.</p>
<p>""If you like President Trump then you won’t like Mike DeWine,"" states the narrator. ""In the Senate, DeWine voted with Hillary Clinton to let illegal immigrants receive Social Security. And in Ohio, DeWine allowed illegal immigrants to receive driver's licenses.""</p>
<p>DeWine’s May 8 primary opponent, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, is a former chair of the PAC and <a href=""https://twitter.com/MaryTaylorOH/status/976783375171309569"">echoed the attack on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>The ad attacks DeWine’s position on other topics including his grade from the NRA, which we have <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2018/mar/06/mary-taylor/gop-ohio-primary-governor-mary-taylor-said-mike-de/"">previously fact-checked</a>.</p>
<p>We found that the ad doesn’t accurately explain DeWine’s Senate vote related to Social Security and requires some context to explain why as Attorney General he concluded that <em>some</em> undocumented immigrants should receive driver’s licenses.</p>
<p>We emailed Onward Ohio and did not get a reply.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">'Let illegal immigrants receive Social Security'</div>
<p>The ad makes it sound as if DeWine wanted to provide a new entitlement for undocumented immigrants by allowing them to qualify for Social Security -- an attack we have seen before against <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/04/national-republican-senatorial-committee/did-mark-pryor-vote-give-social-security-benefits-/"">Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark</a>., and <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/17/sharron-angle/sharron-angle-says-harry-reid-wants-give-illegals-/"">Harry Reid, D-Nev</a>.</p>
<p>In reality, the 2006 vote concerned a much narrower issue -- the treatment of past payroll taxes paid by former undocumented immigrants who would have become legal under an immigration overhaul bill that included border security, a new temporary worker visa and a path to legal status.</p>
<p>At the time, undocumented immigrants had a right to receive credit in their benefits calculation for Social Security payments they had made while working illegally, typically while using an unauthorized Social Security number. They received such credit only after they had received legal working papers and a genuine Social Security number.</p>
<p>During a Senate debate over the broader bill, then-Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., offered an<a href=""https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00130""> amendment </a>to prevent anyone from earning credit for Social Security payments made using an unauthorized Social Security number.</p>
<p>On May 18, 2006, <a href=""http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00130"">the Senate voted</a> 50-49 to table the amendment, effectively killing it. DeWine and Clinton, then a New York senator, were among those who voted in favor of tabling it.</p>
<p>DeWine’s campaign spokesman Ryan Stubenrauch said that DeWine ""voted to table the amendment because he believed that people should keep what they had earned if they could meet the steep requirements to become legal residents.""</p>
<p>DeWine had expressed support for the overall bill because it included border security and also addressed the 12 million undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>""It's a dangerous thing to have them in the underground. We have to put some paper on them and document them,"" he said several weeks before the bill passed.</p>
<p>The House passed its own version, and the two chambers didn’t work out a compromise, so the bills died.</p>

<p>DeWine’s recommendation while he was Ohio attorney general pertained only to a narrow slice of immigrants.</p>
<p>In 2013, Ohio lacked a uniform policy regarding whether to grant driver’s licenses to immigrants who had temporary status through the 2012 program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which began under President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Some state officials issued driver’s licenses, while others refused.</p>
<p>On March 29, 2013, the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles <a href=""https://www.scribd.com/document/133028968/Ohio-BMV-DACA-Media-Release"">announced</a> that Ohio would allow the issuance of temporary licenses to qualified participants in DACA.</p>
<p>The bureau reached a decision after reviewing guidance by DeWine ""that DACA grantees are eligible for temporary driver licenses under Ohio law.""</p>
<p>DeWine wrote in a March 19 <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4417330-Nolan-Stevens-Letter.html"">letter</a> to the Ohio Latino Affairs Commission that DACA recipients could get a Social Security number and work permit.</p>
<p>""With these documents and any other documents normally required by the BMV, an individual can provide the BMV with the information necessary to receive a driver’s license,"" he wrote. ""I encourage any citizen who is concerned about the law or policy to contact their legislators and voice that concern. As Attorney General, I do not have the authority to introduce or vote on legislation.""</p>
<p>DeWine’s campaign said he didn’t issue a formal advisory opinion -- he only expressed his view in a letter, and then it was up to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to issue driver’s licenses.</p>
<p>The TV ad cites a <em><a href=""http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/03/ohio_to_grant_drivers_licenses.html"">Cleveland Plain Dealer</a> </em>article that mentioned DeWine’s conclusion.</p>
<p>David Leopold, an immigration lawyer at Ulmer &amp; Berne in Ohio and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, worked in an advocacy capacity closely with Jose Mendez, a DACA recipient who pushed the issue at the time in Ohio.  </p>
<p>Leopold told PolitiFact that it wasn’t a case of DeWine allowing undocumented immigrants to receive driver’s licenses. He was simply interpreting the DACA policy under Ohio law. Since DACA holders were considered ""lawfully present,"" they were able to provide the necessary information to apply for a driver’s license.</p>
<p>There were around 1,900 immigrants with DACA status in Ohio by the end of May 2013 when U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service first started tracking state data. Overall, there were <a href=""http://www.pewhispanic.org/interactives/unauthorized-trends/"">95,000 undocumented immigrants</a> in Ohio.</p>
<p>As of 2013, the <a href=""https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DACA-and-drivers-licenses-2013-06-19.pdf"">majority of states</a> already gave driver’s licenses to DACA recipients. Two states, Arizona and Nebraska, implemented policies that excluded DACA grantees from driver’s license eligibility, but as a result of litigation or legislative action, both states later issued driver’s licenses, according to the <a href=""https://www.nilc.org/issues/drivers-licenses/daca-and-drivers-licenses/"">National Immigration Law Center</a>.</p>
<p>Trump announced in 2017 he would <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/jan/22/timeline-daca-trump-administration-and-government-/"">rescind DACA</a>. While a federal judge ordered his administration to continue renewals they are not required to process new applications. The<a href=""https://www.npr.org/2018/02/26/588813001/supreme-court-declines-to-take-up-key-daca-case-for-now""> U.S. Supreme Court</a> declined to take it up and Congress hasn’t been able to reach any agreement on DACA.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>Onward Ohio said in a TV ad that ""in the Senate, DeWine voted with Hillary Clinton to let illegal immigrants receive Social Security. And in Ohio, DeWine allowed illegal immigrants to receive driver's licenses.""</p>
<p>On both of these attacks, the ad makes a sweeping statement without filling in viewers about the scope of what a bill and a policy actually said.</p>
<p>The Social Security provision was more narrow than the ad suggests, because it addressed the treatment of past payroll taxes paid by people who at one time had been undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>While attorney general, DeWine concluded that undocumented immigrants who had temporary status through the federal DACA program were entitled to driver’s licenses, but that didn’t apply to all undocumented immigrants. There are kernels of truth here, but the ad fails to provide a complete picture of DeWine’s actions.</p>
<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>

</div>]","A TV ad portrays Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, a Republican candidate for governor, as out of step with President Donald Trump on immigration.
Onward Ohio, a political action committee, launched a statewide TV ad on March 20.
""If you like President Trump then you won’t like Mike DeWine,"" states the narrator. ""In the Senate, DeWine voted with Hillary Clinton to let illegal immigrants receive Social Security. And in Ohio, DeWine allowed illegal immigrants to receive driver's licenses.""
DeWine’s May 8 primary opponent, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, is a former chair of the PAC and echoed the attack on Twitter.
The ad attacks DeWine’s position on other topics including his grade from the NRA, which we have previously fact-checked.
We found that the ad doesn’t accurately explain DeWine’s Senate vote related to Social Security and requires some context to explain why as Attorney General he concluded that some undocumented immigrants should receive driver’s licenses.
We emailed Onward Ohio and did not get a reply.
'Let illegal immigrants receive Social Security'
The ad makes it sound as if DeWine wanted to provide a new entitlement for undocumented immigrants by allowing them to qualify for Social Security -- an attack we have seen before against Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and Harry Reid, D-Nev.
In reality, the 2006 vote concerned a much narrower issue -- the treatment of past payroll taxes paid by former undocumented immigrants who would have become legal under an immigration overhaul bill that included border security, a new temporary worker visa and a path to legal status.
At the time, undocumented immigrants had a right to receive credit in their benefits calculation for Social Security payments they had made while working illegally, typically while using an unauthorized Social Security number. They received such credit only after they had received legal working papers and a genuine Social Security number.
During a Senate debate over the broader bill, then-Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., offered an amendment to prevent anyone from earning credit for Social Security payments made using an unauthorized Social Security number.
On May 18, 2006, the Senate voted 50-49 to table the amendment, effectively killing it. DeWine and Clinton, then a New York senator, were among those who voted in favor of tabling it.
DeWine’s campaign spokesman Ryan Stubenrauch said that DeWine ""voted to table the amendment because he believed that people should keep what they had earned if they could meet the steep requirements to become legal residents.""
DeWine had expressed support for the overall bill because it included border security and also addressed the 12 million undocumented immigrants.
""It's a dangerous thing to have them in the underground. We have to put some paper on them and document them,"" he said several weeks before the bill passed.
The House passed its own version, and the two chambers didn’t work out a compromise, so the bills died.
'DeWine allowed illegal immigrants to receive driver's licenses'
This part of the ad could leave viewers with the misleading impression that DeWine took actions to allow all undocumented immigrants to get drivers’ licenses.

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>In a post-election interview that focused on incarceration and policing, U.S. Rep. <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/personalities/gwen-moore/"">Gwen Moore</a> was asked about Republican President-elect <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/"">Donald Trump</a>.</p>
<p>And she made a claim about him and the controversial police practice called ""stop-and-frisk"" -- the practice of a police officer stopping and questioning a person, then patting the person down for weapons.</p>
<p>Here was part of the exchange the Huffington Post had with the Milwaukee Democrat, according to <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mass-incarceration-gwen-moore_us_582f6247e4b099512f82bdfd"">an article</a> posted Nov. 18, 2016:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>Policing plays a huge role in our mass incarceration problem. Do you think policing could change at all under Trump?  </em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Moore: </strong><em>He’s shared a lot of stuff with us. He thinks stop-and-frisk is fine! (Former New York Mayor) Rudy Giuliani thinks it’s fine. And I don’t know where they’ll land in his administration. According to him, a lot of things he said and did were just Hollywood and bluster and now he’s going to be presidential.<br/>
<br/>
If stop-and-frisk was just part of the dog whistle he knew he needed to put out there to get all of the angry white men to come out of the rural areas to vote for him ― we don’t (know) if that was just something he said to get elected. So a lot of us are trying to be hopeful.</em></p>
<p>So, where does Trump stand on stop-and-frisk?</p>
<p><strong>Trump statements</strong></p>
<p>As <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/elections/2016/president-united-states/"">the campaign</a> with <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/personalities/hillary-clinton/"">Hillary Clinton</a>, the Democratic nominee, entered its final weeks, Trump made headlines with comments about stop-and-frisk.</p>
<p>On Sept. 21, 2016, at a Fox News-televised town hall at a church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, Trump <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/donald-trump-stop-and-frisk-228486"">called for</a> <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/us/politics/donald-trump-don-king-black-voters.html?_r=1"">wider use</a> of stop-and-frisk to combat violent crime. An audience member had asked Trump how he would stop crime in the black community. Trump responded that stop-and-frisk would be one of the things he would do, <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/09/21/trump-praises-stop-and-frisk-police-tactic-at-african-american-town-hall.html"">adding</a>:</p>
<p><em>I think you have to [do it]. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive ….In New York City, it was so incredible the way it worked.</em></p>
<p>Five days later, at the <a href=""https://medium.com/@PolitiFact/politifacts-annotated-transcript-of-the-first-presidential-debate-9d7ff2fb9841#.8g63tb4mp"">first presidential debate</a>, moderator Lester Holt asked Trump what he would do to heal racial divides. Trump said:</p>
<p><em>We have to bring back law and order. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn’t be having it ….</em></p>
<p>Moments later, Holt said: ""The argument is that it’s a form of racial profiling"" and Trump replied:</p>
<p><em>No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn’t have them. These are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn’t be — when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.</em></p>
<p>And later in the debate, Trump’s praise was more effusive when he said:</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

</article>
</section>
</div>]","In a post-election interview that focused on incarceration and policing, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore was asked about Republican President-elect Donald Trump.
And she made a claim about him and the controversial police practice called ""stop-and-frisk"" -- the practice of a police officer stopping and questioning a person, then patting the person down for weapons.
Here was part of the exchange the Huffington Post had with the Milwaukee Democrat, according to an article posted Nov. 18, 2016:
Question: Policing plays a huge role in our mass incarceration problem. Do you think policing could change at all under Trump?  

Moore: He’s shared a lot of stuff with us. He thinks stop-and-frisk is fine! (Former New York Mayor) Rudy Giuliani thinks it’s fine. And I don’t know where they’ll land in his administration. According to him, a lot of things he said and did were just Hollywood and bluster and now he’s going to be presidential.

If stop-and-frisk was just part of the dog whistle he knew he needed to put out there to get all of the angry white men to come out of the rural areas to vote for him ― we don’t (know) if that was just something he said to get elected. So a lot of us are trying to be hopeful.
So, where does Trump stand on stop-and-frisk?
Trump statements
As the campaign with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, entered its final weeks, Trump made headlines with comments about stop-and-frisk.
On Sept. 21, 2016, at a Fox News-televised town hall at a church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, Trump called for wider use of stop-and-frisk to combat violent crime. An audience member had asked Trump how he would stop crime in the black community. Trump responded that stop-and-frisk would be one of the things he would do, adding:
I think you have to [do it]. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive ….In New York City, it was so incredible the way it worked.
Five days later, at the first presidential debate, moderator Lester Holt asked Trump what he would do to heal racial divides. Trump said:
We have to bring back law and order. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn’t be having it ….
Moments later, Holt said: ""The argument is that it’s a form of racial profiling"" and Trump replied:
No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn’t have them. These are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn’t be — when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.
And later in the debate, Trump’s praise was more effusive when he said:",PolitiFact,"
In New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders …. Stop-and-frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.
Two parentheticals on Trump in the debate:


He claimed stop-and-frisk was not ruled unconstitutional in New York. PolitiFact National rated the statement Mostly False.




On his claim that stop-and-frisk ""brought the crime way down"" in New York City, the Washington Post Fact Checker observed: ""Crime is affected by many factors, and New York’s decline in crime mirrored the decline in many other major cities at the time. Moreover, crime was declining for four years before Giuliani took office, and it continued to decline for 14 years after he left.""


It’s also worth noting that Trump’s support for stop-and-frisk goes back to at least 2013, when he said on Twitter:
Stop and frisk works. Instead of criticizing @NY_POLICE Chief Ray Kelly, New Yorkers should be thanking him for keeping NY safe.
And:
If Stop &amp; Frisk is struck down by the pandering NYC politicians, increases in crime &amp; eventual terrorist attacks will be on them.
We didn’t get a response when we asked Trump’s campaign about Moore’s claim.
But we couldn’t find any statements indicating Trump has changed his position.
Our rating
Moore said Trump ""thinks stop-and-frisk is fine.""
During the 2016 presidential campaign, less than two months before the election, Trump made a series of statements praising stop-and-frisk, repeating his claim that it reduces crime and saying the controversial police tactic should be used more broadly around the country.
We rate Moore’s statement True.

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<p>The conservative publication PJ Media says in a headline spreading virally on Facebook that the New York Times admitted a new allegation against Justice Brett Kavanaugh is ""fake news,"" but that is misleading.</p>
<p>The back-and-forth stems from a Sept. 14 <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/sunday-review/brett-kavanaugh-deborah-ramirez-yale.html"">report</a> in the New York Times that contains a previously unreported accusation of sexual impropriety by Kavanaugh while a student at Yale.</p>
<p>After its initial reporting, the New York Times added more information to its story online and published an editor’s note explaining its decision. </p>
<p>We’ll walk through what changed in the Times story in a second. But it was not as PJ Media claimed in its <a href=""https://pjmedia.com/trending/new-york-times-now-admits-new-kavanaugh-accusation-is-fake-news/?fbclid=IwAR21ilHVSvgOwdY1-Aqi0X06Yk4TByZlzT9z4LCcaHMHTa9J3BbZklUxz8I"">headline</a>, ""New York Times Now Admits New Kavanaugh Accusation Is Fake News.""</p>
<p>""On Sunday, The New York Times added a retraction to its story attacking Brett Kavanaugh, admitting that the female student allegedly assaulted had no recollection of the event. (Writers) Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly have egg on their faces,"" a blurb that ran alongside the PJ Media article reads.</p>
<p>PJ Media’s managing editor Paula Bolyard told us that the PJ Media article was an opinion piece, and said that author Matt Margolis’ use of the phrase ""fake news"" was a ""rhetorical manner of expression."" Bolyard noted that other outlets — among them <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/16/media/new-york-times-kavanaugh/index.html"">CNN</a>, <a href=""https://thehill.com/media/461697-new-york-times-authors-on-kavanaugh-report-there-was-zero-intent-to-mislead"">The Hill</a> and <a href=""http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/nyt-correction-kavanaugh-story.html"">New York Magazine</a> — referred to the New York Times’ update as a ""correction.""</p>
<p>There are elements of opinion in PJ Media's post, but it’s important for online readers to know that the Times did not retract or reverse its reporting, as PJ Media's headline suggests.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Error and update</div>
<p>The article in question was adapted from a forthcoming book by New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, ""The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation."" The book delves into Kavanaugh’s background, including an alleged pattern of sexual misconduct that first came into public view around the time of Kavanaugh’s contentious Oct. 2018 Supreme Court confirmation hearing. </p>
<p>The Sept. 14, 2019, New York Times article ""<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/sunday-review/brett-kavanaugh-deborah-ramirez-yale.html"">Brett Kavanaugh Fit In With the Privileged Kids. She Did Not</a>"" ignited a firestorm, and even led to some Democratic presidential candidates calling for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. </p>
<p>It depicted a previously unreported scene in which Kavanaugh, then a Yale student in the 1980s, was said to have engaged in lewd conduct at a ""drunken dorm party."" Here’s how the account appears in the New York Times; the bolded section was added after the article’s initial publication: </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;"">""We also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez’s allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student. Mr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the F.B.I. about this account, but the F.B.I. did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly. We corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier; <strong>the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the episode</strong>.""</p>
<p>And here is the editor’s note the New York Times published Sept. 15, 2019, explaining the change to its story: </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;"">""An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.""</p>
<p>Amid the fallout over its reporting, the Times’ deputy editorial page editor James Dao <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/reader-center/brett-kavanaugh-accusation-yale.html"">published</a> written answers to five questions from readers, including a question about why the Times decided to print an allegation that some viewed as insufficiently supported. Here’s how Dao responded:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;"">DAO: ""The essay included a previously unreported claim that friends pushed Mr. Kavanaugh’s penis into the hand of a female Yale student during a dorm party with drunken classmates. During the authors’ investigation, they learned that a classmate, Max Stier, witnessed the event and later reported it to senators and to the F.B.I. The authors corroborated his story with two government officials, who said they found it credible. Based on that corroboration, we felt mentioning the claim as one part of a broader essay was warranted.""</p>
<p>New York Times spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha told PolitiFact the PJ Media headline is ""inaccurate,"" and added that ""the editors' note is not a retraction in any way.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Dissecting the change</div>
<p>As the above text shows, the Times’ explanation may call Stier’s allegation into question. But nowhere does the Times admit it peddled ""fake news,"" which gives the impression of having misled its readers.</p>
<p>For their part, Times’ reporters Kelly and Pogrebin <a href=""https://www.mediaite.com/news/kavanaugh-book-co-authors-say-nyt-editors-cut-key-detail-about-alleged-victim-not-remembering-the-assault/"">appeared</a> on MSNBC and said the additional details were included in their original draft but were omitted as a result of an editing error. ""There was zero intent to mislead anybody about the details of the incident,"" Kelly said.</p>
<p>Ha, the Times' spokesperson, elaborated on this explanation.</p>
<p>""In the original article editors decided not include some information about a female student at Yale that is provided in Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin's book, including her name, in part to protect her privacy because she was not the source for the account in the adaptation,"" Ha told PolitiFact. ""After publication editors agreed with some readers that the adaptation should include the same information as the book, so the piece was updated."" </p>
<p>The Times also did not retract the article or the specific allegation against Kavanaugh, as PJ Media said. A retraction would include removing the allegation entirely because it cannot be corroborated. The source of this allegation is Max Stier, a classmate of Kavanaugh’s.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the New York Times said it did not initially publish all relevant information when it ran the article, and the omitted information may call into question the credibility of the accusation. But the Times has since added that information, and wrote an editor’s note explaining their decision. </p>
<p>The Times has not retracted its reporting on the allegation or admitted it was incorrect. Sites claiming so have gone too far. </p>

<p>It led to calls for a criminal investigation <a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/04/republicans-trump-raffensperger-454636"">and</a> even for <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/01/04/impeach-trump-on-his-way-out-bar-him-from-future-office-column/4125422001/"">Trump’s</a> <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2021/01/04/953151921/trumps-call-to-georgia-election-officials-sparks-debate-over-legality-ethics"">impeachment</a>, with only weeks before his term ends and President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated.</p>

<p>The fact that the Jan. 2 <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-transcript-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/2768e0cc-4ddd-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html"">call</a> was recorded and leaked to the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html"">news</a> <a href=""https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/trump-demands-georgia-elections-official-overturn-his-defeat-in-hourlong-call/6MRGK445JNAGHBL2HXLZ3FIVZU/"">media</a> also spurred a claim that Raffensperger ""faces espionage charges.""</p>

The tweet, which alludes to the Washington Post <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html"">story</a> that revealed the telephone call, claimed that the White House is ""planning to refer Brad Raffensperger WaPo leak to Secret Service for investigation under national security grounds of the Espionage Act.""</p>
<p>Neither the article nor the tweet cites any evidence that Raffensperger is facing espionage charges. The White House, the Secret Service and TenNapel didn’t reply to our requests for information.</p>
<p>As for how the recording was leaked, the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-transcript-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/2768e0cc-4ddd-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html"">Post</a> and the <a href=""https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/trump-demands-georgia-elections-official-overturn-his-defeat-in-hourlong-call/6MRGK445JNAGHBL2HXLZ3FIVZU/"">Atlanta</a> Journal-Constitution both reported that they obtained the recording the day after the phone conversation, but did not say how they obtained it. Raffensperger’s office did not respond to our requests for comment. </p>
<p>Vladeck and Asha Rangappa, a Yale University national security law instructor and former FBI agent, said that both Georgia and Washington, D.C., are one-party consent jurisdictions — meaning it is legal to record, and to distribute recordings, made with only one party’s consent.</p>
<p>Raffensperger has <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/532589-raffensperger-if-youre-going-to-put-out-stuff-that-we-dont-believe-is-true"">indicated</a> that the recording was released because Trump’s <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1345731043861659650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1345753643593687040%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fpolitics%2Fpolitics-news%2Fgeorgia-s-raffensperger-says-he-never-believed-it-appropriate-speak-n1252724"">tweet</a> ""broke privacy"" and contained false information.

<p>Vladeck <a href=""https://twitter.com/steve_vladeck/status/1345938482737377283"">knocked</a> down Posobiec’s report on Twitter.

""Man tracks down his 3-year-old daughter’s rapist,"" reads what looks like a headline over an image of a man walking between authorities with his arms raised. It goes on to say the father dismembered the rapist and then cooked and forced the offender to eat his own body part. 
""A hero,"" reads one comment. ""He did what had to be done,"" reads another.
But the Oct. 27 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)
A reverse image search quickly proves this claim wrong. ",PolitiFact,"
Using TinEye, we found a 2017 Daily Mail story about conflict in South Africa between Black residents and immigrants. 
The caption of the photo, attributed to the European Pressphoto Agency, says: ""A South African resident is arrested by police after allegedly looting and clashing with foreign residents during a xenophobic march by the Mamelodi Concerned Residents through the streets of Pretoria."" 
We couldn’t find any news reports detailing what’s claimed in the Instagram post. A 2014 Independent headline came close: ""Father ‘cooked dinner for his daughter’s rapist before torturing and killing him.’"" The story says the father of a 14-year-old daughter reportedly burned her ""alleged attacker’s genitals with hot tongs before he died.""
But this claim is False.

<p><strong>Facebook</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is a bit harder to pin down. It does have the ability to suppress or highlight stories by altering its algorithm, though no one has produced evidence that this is something Facebook did with the FBI story.</p>
<p>Further, Facebook <a href=""http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/08/search-fyi-an-update-to-trending/"">tailors</a> its trending topics based on the particular user’s interests. So the FBI story may not have appeared in one person’s trending topics bar, while appearing in another’s.</p>
<p>While these companies probably don’t suppress certain stories, it’s hard to disprove a claim like Trump’s beyond a shadow of a doubt because there are so many ways social media sites could manipulate content visibility, said Kjerstin Thorson, a communications professor at Michigan State University.  </p>
<p>""Did it appear on people’s trending box space on Facebook? How long was it there? Was it trending only for some people and not for others? Was the story made visible in people’s Facebook news feeds or Twitter streams or in Google search results, via each platform’s display algorithm?"" Thorson said.  ""Outside of internal company data, there is no source I know of who could check that.""</p>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>Trump said, ""Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!""</p>
<p>Trump has not produced any evidence whatsoever to back up his claim, nor has anyone else. We found nothing to support the idea that the three tech and social media companies reduced the visibility of the latest developments in the Clinton email controversy.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/nov/01/principles-politifact-punditfact-and-truth-o-meter/"">burden</a> is on Trump to produce information to support his statement. He’s offered none.</p>

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>One day after a shooter opened fire on a Tops supermarket in Buffalo, New York, a local news station based in Orlando, Florida, ran a report from the scene of the massacre. </p>
<p>The segment that WKMG-TV ran was a package shared from a partner affiliate in Houston, KPRC-TV, featuring a report that KPRC reporter Brandon Walker filmed from Buffalo. </p>
<p>""Good evening to you from Buffalo, the northeast side of town,"" Walker said in the May 15 report as he stood outside the supermarket, yellow police tape still stretched behind him. </p>
<p>""Tonight, as FBI investigators continue to process the scene inside Tops Friendly Market, community members reflect on how they feel,"" Walker said. ""There's a lot of sadness, a lot of anger, too, over the racism they say fueled 18-year-old Payton Gendron’s actions.""</p>
<p>The problem: Walker was wrongly introduced by WKMG anchor Erik von Ancken as ""Walker Graham,"" and the chyron at the bottom of the screen identified him the same way.</p>
<p>In a statement to PolitiFact, WKMG’s assignment desk said the script the station received from KPRC listed Walker’s name as ""Walker Graham,"" and the error was carried over onto the air. At the end of his report, Walker signed off by saying, ""I’m Brandon Walker.""</p>
<p>But across social media, the mixup was a sign of something more nefarious, a conspiracy in which Walker was playing the role of a reporter as a ""crisis actor"" on the set of a staged attack.</p>
<p>The ""crisis actor"" claims started with a tweet that put a photo of Walker’s report for WKMG, in which he’s listed as ""Walker Graham,"" next to a report he did for KPRC under the correct name.</p>
<p>""So he just got two different names depending on the news station?"" said the <a href=""https://archive.ph/2jWma"">May 16 tweet</a>. ""One day people, one day you’ll realize why people like me question EVERYTHING.""</p>
<p>Screenshots of the tweet quickly spread to Instagram and Facebook, where they were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

</div>]","One day after a shooter opened fire on a Tops supermarket in Buffalo, New York, a local news station based in Orlando, Florida, ran a report from the scene of the massacre. 
The segment that WKMG-TV ran was a package shared from a partner affiliate in Houston, KPRC-TV, featuring a report that KPRC reporter Brandon Walker filmed from Buffalo. 
""Good evening to you from Buffalo, the northeast side of town,"" Walker said in the May 15 report as he stood outside the supermarket, yellow police tape still stretched behind him. 
""Tonight, as FBI investigators continue to process the scene inside Tops Friendly Market, community members reflect on how they feel,"" Walker said. ""There's a lot of sadness, a lot of anger, too, over the racism they say fueled 18-year-old Payton Gendron’s actions.""
The problem: Walker was wrongly introduced by WKMG anchor Erik von Ancken as ""Walker Graham,"" and the chyron at the bottom of the screen identified him the same way.
In a statement to PolitiFact, WKMG’s assignment desk said the script the station received from KPRC listed Walker’s name as ""Walker Graham,"" and the error was carried over onto the air. At the end of his report, Walker signed off by saying, ""I’m Brandon Walker.""
But across social media, the mixup was a sign of something more nefarious, a conspiracy in which Walker was playing the role of a reporter as a ""crisis actor"" on the set of a staged attack.
The ""crisis actor"" claims started with a tweet that put a photo of Walker’s report for WKMG, in which he’s listed as ""Walker Graham,"" next to a report he did for KPRC under the correct name.
""So he just got two different names depending on the news station?"" said the May 16 tweet. ""One day people, one day you’ll realize why people like me question EVERYTHING.""
Screenshots of the tweet quickly spread to Instagram and Facebook, where they were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) ",PolitiFact,"
""Let’s give a warm welcome to the latest crisis actor in the Buffalo show!"" one Instagram post said. Another post on Facebook said simply, ""#CrisisActor.""
Among the people pushing the false ""crisis actor"" claim was Lauren Witzke, the far-right GOP nominee for a 2020 U.S. Senate seat from Delaware, who has promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory. ""New Buffalo crisis actor just dropped,"" Witzke said in posts on Telegram and Instagram.

PolitiFact previously debunked a Pants on Fire claim that Gendron, who was charged for the shooting, was a ""crisis actor."" There is no evidence that the attack was staged or a ""false flag."" There were multiple witnesses, and the shooter live streamed the assault.
This claim about Walker is also baseless.
""This is a real reporter,"" WKMG’s assignment desk said in its statement to PolitiFact. Walker has worked for KPRC since 2015, according to his bio on the KPRC website.
In a reply to the original tweet that set off the ""crisis actor"" conspiracy theory, Walker wrote: ""Seems my colleagues at a sister station don’t know my name. Brandon Walker, it is. I work for a station in Houston, KPRC2; however, I’ve filed reports for our sister stations in other cities.""
Walker and KPRC did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. 
Another Houston-area journalist tweeted that KPRC and WKMG both are owned by Graham Media Group, a broadcasting company, which might have prompted the ""Walker Graham"" error.

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>Illinois’ 20th House district is considered one of the most important in-state races to watch come Election Day in the battle for seats between Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan and GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner.</p>
<p>The district, which includes parts of Chicago’s Northwest side and nearby suburbs,features Republican state Rep. MichaelMcAuliffe defending his seat from first-time candidate Democrat Merry Marwig. McAuliffe’s defense includes a new television ad that calls Marwig corrupt and ties her to Madigan because she has successfully appealed her property tax bills.</p>
<p>The ad, titled ""Inside Game,"" is a 30-second spot running in the Chicago area and was produced by Citizens for Michael McAuliffe and the Illinois House Republican Organization.</p>
<p>Here’s the transcript:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>""Mike Madigan made a fortune on tax appeals. Representing the powerful and politically connected. Saving his friends millions. Forcing you to pay more. It’s an inside game played by people like Merry Marwig, Madigan’s hand-picked candidate. When Marwig thought her property taxes were too high she got them lowered at your expense. Saved so much she did it again. Marwig and Madigan: Profiting from the same corrupt system.""</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It got us wondering: Did Marwig get her property taxes lowered? Did Madigan have anything to do with it? Is it corrupt to get your property taxes lowered? We took a look to find out.</p>
<p><strong>Madigan’s law firm and tax appeals</strong></p>
<p>The opening line of the advertisement says: ""Mike Madigan made a fortune on tax appeals. Representing the powerful and politically connected. Saving his friends millions.""</p>
<p>Madigan’s personal law firm, Madigan &amp; Getzendanner, has made quite a bit of money from property tax appeals. According to <a href=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-met-michael-madigan-0124-20100122-story.html"">the <em>Chicago Tribune</em></a>, Madigan &amp; Getzendanner represented 45 of the 150 most valuable Chicago downtown buildings in 2008. The Tribune also found ""Madigan's firm won enough appeals to cut more than $183 million from the taxable value of the top high-rises it represented"" in 2006.</p>
<p>A 2013 Chicago Magazine article also backs this claim, citing a <em>Sun-Timesarticle that says over the course of a decade Madigan &amp; Getzendanner made nearly $14 million for suburban Cook County landowners.</em></p>
<p><strong>Madigan and Marwig </strong> </p>
<p>Where the ad gets murky is when it starts linking Marwig to Madigan. The advertisement says Madigan ""saved his friends millions, forcing you to pay more."" It also says Marwig is Madigan’s ""hand-picked candidate."" The ad lays out these ideas in an order that implies Madigan’s firm represented Marwig during her property value reassessment. However, Marwig and her husband were not represented by an attorney and filled out the forms themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Marwig’s property taxes</strong></p>
<p>Next, the ad claims Marwig had her property taxes ""lowered at your expense. Saved so much she did it again.""</p>
<p>Marwig once unsuccessfully appealed to the Cook County Assessor to have her property value lowered in 2015. However, she successfully appealed to the Cook County Board of Review twice. It resulted in getting her property taxes lowered by about $400 in her 2013 appeal and then about $700 in her 2015 appeal.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>Marwig believes there is a double standard for McAuliffe to criticize her practices. In an emailed statement to Reboot Illinois she said:</p>
<p>""For Mike McAuliffe -- a 20-year politician who has personally benefited from a property tax appeal -- to attack my family for going through the legal process of correcting a government error in an unfair tax bill is another sad example of what’s wrong with the politics and hypocrisy that local residents are so fed up with.""</p>
<p>Note: McAuliffe did benefit from getting his property taxes lowered when his condominium association appealed its property value in 2012. However, McAuliffe did not file the claim himself.</p>
<p>And when the advertisement says Marwig got her property taxes ""lowered at your expense,"" it’s technically correct. But Chicago-based property appeals lawyer Gary H. Smith believes the ad implies Marwig is stealing, which is not actually the case.  </p>
<p>""It’s got elements of the truth,"" Smith said. ""When someone gets their property assessment lowered, it has to be made up by everyone else.""</p>
<p>But is it corrupt? The ad ends by saying, ""Marwig and Madigan: Profiting from the same corrupt system.""</p>
<p>Not at all, Smith says. Anyone, regardless of whether they are regular citizen or a political candidate, can appeal a property tax bill if they believe it is inaccurate.</p>
<p>According to the most recent available data from the Cook County Board of Review website, citizens filed appeals for nearly 403,000 parcels in 2013. The Board of Review approved a reduction for 63 percent of them.</p>
<p>Smith said the ad’s message is misleading and paints the practice of property value reassessment as ugly.</p>
<p>""It’s horrible we live in a society that a system that’s meant to improve our lives might be perceived as a detriment based on a person’s political status,"" Smith said.</p>

<p>Merry Marwig did, in fact, get her property taxes lowered twice and it did raise other people’s taxes. But the ad’s tone and inferences are misleading to viewers.</p>
<p>It makes it seem like Madigan’s firm was connected to Marwig’s property value reassessment. Madigan’s firm never represented Marwig. In fact, Marwig never used an attorney during her property tax appeals.</p>
<p>The ad also calls the practice of appealing one’s property taxes corrupt. While there is evidence Madigan has been a highly successful property tax appeal lawyer whose clients win breaks more than many others, any citizen within the geographic boundary can file an appeal to the Cook County Assessor's Office or Cook County Board of Review. The process becomes public record. While some people may think Madigan succeeds more than average citizens, there’s no evidence the system as a whole is corrupt.</p>

<p>The election worker replies: ""Here’s your ballot."" A sign in the background says: ""HR 1 for election fraud act.""</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://archive.is/ZUrYe"">Facebook post</a> was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related"">partnership</a> with Facebook.) Editorial cartoons may be funny, but if they convey a factual message, we hold them to <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2015/aug/20/why-fact-check-political-cartoons/"">a standard of accuracy</a>, just as we do with other forms of political commentary. </p>
<p>The cartoon on voting was drawn by Gary Varvel, a conservative <a href=""https://garyvarvel.com/"">syndicated cartoonist</a>. Varvel did not respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p>The implication of the cartoon is that H.R. 1, a Democratic-backed bill moving through Congress, would allow minors and immigrants in the U.S. illegally to vote. That’s inaccurate.</p>
<p>The cartoon’s implications about voter ID and same-day registration, meanwhile, leave out important context and could create misunderstanding about the bill’s provisions.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1/text"">H.R. 1</a>, known as the For the People Act, combines proposals for voter registration, absentee voting, in-person voting, campaign finance and ethics related to federal elections. The Democratic-led House passed the bill March 3 largely, along party lines. The Senate is expected to take up the bill this month.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">H.R. 1 doesn’t let minors vote</div>
<p>The bill says that states must accept an application to register to vote from anyone who is at least 16 years old. This process is known as <a href=""https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/preregistration-for-young-voters.aspx"">""preregistration""</a> and is already allowed in some states for people who are 16 or 17, so they can begin voting at age 18. Some states also permit 17-year-olds to vote in primary elections, if they will turn 18 before the general election. </p>
<p>However, H.R. 1 <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1/text"">states</a> that the bill has ""no effect on state voting age requirements,"" and that nothing in the preregistration provision ""may be construed to require a state to permit an individual who is under 18 years of age at the time of an election for federal office to vote in the election.""</p>
<p>The House rejected a proposed <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/amendment/117th-congress/house-amendment/22?s=1&amp;r=1"">amendment</a> to lower the voting age to 16.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">H.R. 1 does not allow voting by immigrants in the U.S. illegally</div>
<p>The bill <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/mar/05/mike-pence/pence-falsely-says-if-hr-1-passes-millions-people-/"">does not permit voting by noncitizens</a> in U.S. elections, whether they’re in the country legally or not. </p>
<p>A provision in the bill would facilitate automatic voter registration for people using services at government agencies. But that section says government agencies would pass along a person’s information for voter registration only if they are citizens. People would still have to attest that they are eligible to vote, with penalties for lying, and it would still be up to election officials to verify their eligibility. </p>

<p>The bill says that if a state requires voters to present an ID to cast a ballot, it must allow a voter, as an alternative, to present election officials a sworn written statement attesting to their identity and eligibility to vote.</p>
<p>""This is actually a common practice used in several states, and since the vast majority of voters have identification and carry it with them, it is rarely used,"" David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, previously told PolitiFact. ""But this alternative can be important for those few eligible voters that might have difficulty meeting restrictive identification requirements."" </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Same-day registration</div>
<p>The bill would mandate that states allow any eligible person to register to vote on the day of a federal election and cast a ballot, or to revise their registration information on Election Day.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx"">National Conference of State Legislatures</a> found that as of October, <a href=""https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx"">21 states plus the District of Columbia</a> already allowed same-day registration.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">What the bill says about election security</div>
<p>The sign in the cartoon calls H.R. 1 the ""for election fraud act"" — implying that it would lead to fraud. We can’t fact-check a prediction, but there are several provisions in the bill that discourage fraud, including grants to states to improve the security of their voting systems and audits of voting systems. </p>
<p>The bill requires information sharing from the federal government to the states about security, including cybersecurity threats. It directs the director of national intelligence to submit an assessment of threats posed by state actors and terrorist groups to chief state election officials and congressional committees. It also creates a bounty program to reward individuals, organizations and companies that report previously unidentified security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/h-r-1s-election-security-and-integrity-provisions-need-work/"">Bipartisan Policy Center</a> said many of the provisions would make progress toward ensuring election security, but said that the legislation still falls short in this area.</p>
<p>""Congress must authorize regularized funding for election security, aimed at repelling foreign intrusion into the voting process,"" the center wrote. ""That includes mandating a way to get future funding into the hands of local election officials who are most responsible for the voting infrastructure.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>A cartoon on Facebook said that under H.R. 1, a person can still vote if they are 16, in the U.S. illegally, have no ID and have not registered to vote.</p>
<p>The cartoon is wrong on the first two points: The legislation would allow 16-year-olds to preregister, but not cast ballots, and only eligible citizens can vote.</p>
<p>It leaves out important context on the other two points. The legislation would allow a process for a voter without ID to present a sworn statement instead, and it would allow same-day registration. Many states already have these provisions.</p>
<p>The overall message of the cartoon is that H.R. 1 opens the door to fraud and allowing ineligible people to vote. It ignores the security provisions and eligibility checks in the bill.</p>

Is abortion at an all-time low in the United States?

<div adbridg-ad-class=""mobileinterstitial""></div>
<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>Assemblyman Kevin Cahill, D-Kingston, said abortions are less common now than ever before in the U.S.</p>
<p>Cahill claimed the number of abortions has decreased to the lowest point in history four decades after the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>""After the right was expanded, there was a rise in the number of abortions,"" Cahill said in a <a href=""http://www.wcny.org/october-11-2017-asm-kevin-cahill/"">radio interview</a>. ""But that number has subsided tremendously. It is at an all time legal low.""</p>
<p>Most Democrats in the state legislature, Cahill included, support <a href=""https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/s2796/amendment/original"">a bill</a> that would guarantee access to abortion services in New York state if the Supreme Court overturns the landmark decision.</p>
<p>Cahill believes having that access would keep the number of abortions low in New York state. But is he right that there are fewer abortions now than ever in the U.S.?</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Abortion data</strong></div>
<p>Abortion was not universally legal in the U.S. until the Supreme Court decision in 1973. Earlier national data on legal abortions does not exist, and the number of illegal abortions performed before the decision is impossible to know.</p>
<p>Cahill was talking about the number of abortions in the U.S. in his claim, according to his office.</p>
<p>Two organizations have statistics on abortion that date back to 1973: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health policy and research organization.</p>
<p>Data from the Guttmacher Institute is considered more comprehensive than CDC data. The CDC relies on numbers reported from states while the Guttmacher Institute does its own census of known abortion providers in every state.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Number of abortions</strong></div>
<p>There were 744,610 abortions in the U.S. in 1973, according to the Guttmacher Institute.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>Cahill’s right that the number of legal abortions increased immediately after Roe v. Wade. The Guttmacher data shows the number peaked in 1988, when 1,590,750 abortions were recorded.</p>
<p>That number has since decreased, aside from two small increases in 1996 and 2008. The Guttmacher data does not show each year’s count, instead tracking it every two to three years.</p>
<p>The number of abortions decreased to 926,190 in 2014, the latest reporting period. That’s still higher than when the institute starting tracking the data in 1973.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>The abortion rate</strong></div>
<p>Measured another way -- abortions per capita -- the rate is at an all-time low. There were about 54 million more women living in the U.S. in 2014 than in 1973, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>In 1973, there were 16.3 abortions for every 1,000 women, and the 29.3 rate in 1980 remains an all-time high. There were 14.6 abortions for every 1,000 women in 2014, according to the Guttmacher Institute.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>New York state data</strong></div>
<p>In New York state, both the count and the rate fell to an all-time low in 2013 before increasing slightly in 2014.</p>
<p>There were 119,940 abortions in New York state in 2014, compared with 212,700 in 1973. The rate has decreased from 54.5 abortions for every 1,000 women in 1973 to 29.6 in 2014.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Our ruling</strong></div>
<p>Cahill said abortion ""is at an all time legal low.""</p>
<p>That's true if you consider the rate. The 14.6 abortions for every 1,000 women in 2014 is an all-time low.</p>
<p>But his statement is false when counting the number. The number of abortions has gone down since its peak in 1988, but has not dropped below the 1973 count.</p>
<p>The statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.</p>

""After the right was expanded, there was a rise in the number of abortions,"" Cahill said in a radio interview. ""But that number has subsided tremendously. It is at an all time legal low.""
Most Democrats in the state legislature, Cahill included, support a bill that would guarantee access to abortion services in New York state if the Supreme Court overturns the landmark decision.
Cahill believes having that access would keep the number of abortions low in New York state. But is he right that there are fewer abortions now than ever in the U.S.?
Abortion data
Abortion was not universally legal in the U.S. until the Supreme Court decision in 1973. Earlier national data on legal abortions does not exist, and the number of illegal abortions performed before the decision is impossible to know.
Cahill was talking about the number of abortions in the U.S. in his claim, according to his office.
Two organizations have statistics on abortion that date back to 1973: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health policy and research organization.
Data from the Guttmacher Institute is considered more comprehensive than CDC data. The CDC relies on numbers reported from states while the Guttmacher Institute does its own census of known abortion providers in every state.
Number of abortions
There were 744,610 abortions in the U.S. in 1973, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

By Tom Kertscher • May 18, 2023







Cahill’s right that the number of legal abortions increased immediately after Roe v. Wade. The Guttmacher data shows the number peaked in 1988, when 1,590,750 abortions were recorded.
That number has since decreased, aside from two small increases in 1996 and 2008. The Guttmacher data does not show each year’s count, instead tracking it every two to three years.
The number of abortions decreased to 926,190 in 2014, the latest reporting period. That’s still higher than when the institute starting tracking the data in 1973.
The abortion rate
Measured another way -- abortions per capita -- the rate is at an all-time low. There were about 54 million more women living in the U.S. in 2014 than in 1973, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
In 1973, there were 16.3 abortions for every 1,000 women, and the 29.3 rate in 1980 remains an all-time high. There were 14.6 abortions for every 1,000 women in 2014, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
New York state data
In New York state, both the count and the rate fell to an all-time low in 2013 before increasing slightly in 2014.
There were 119,940 abortions in New York state in 2014, compared with 212,700 in 1973. The rate has decreased from 54.5 abortions for every 1,000 women in 1973 to 29.6 in 2014.
<strong",PolitiFact,"
Cahill said abortion ""is at an all time legal low.""
That's true if you consider the rate. The 14.6 abortions for every 1,000 women in 2014 is an all-time low.
But his statement is false when counting the number. The number of abortions has gone down since its peak in 1988, but has not dropped below the 1973 count.
The statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

Old Internet claim that Obama will be on new $1 bill is still wrong
</h2>
</header>
<div adbridg-ad-class=""mobileinterstitial""></div>
<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>A persistent, false claim running on numerous blogs says former President Barack Obama will replace George Washington on the $1 bill this year. The report is actually worthless.</p>
<p>""Barrack Obama will be on new $1 dollar bill 2017,"" reads a headline on a <a href=""http://trueamericans.me/barrack-obama-will-be-on-new-1-dollar-bill-2017"">Jan. 26, 2017, post </a>on TrueAmericans.me. It included a illustration (shown above) of what such a dollar may look like. The same site posted a poll asking readers <a href=""http://trueamericans.me/poll-do-you-want-to-see-barack-obama-on-new-1-dollar-bill-2017"">whether they supported the move</a>.</p>
<p>The claim was flagged by Facebook, which is trying to crack down on fabricated articles that resemble real news.</p>
<p>The false story, complete with the misspelling of ""Barack,"" <a href=""http://healthyworldhouse.com/index.php/2017/01/18/barrack-obama-will-new-1-dollar-bill-2017/"">appeared</a> <a href=""http://usinfonews.com/index.php/2017/01/23/must-read-barrack-obama-will-new-1-dollar-bill-2017/"">on several</a> <a href=""http://www.anonjekloy.tk/2017/01/barrack-obama-will-be-on-new-1-dollar.html"">other</a> <a href=""http://damnleaks.com/barrack-obama-will-be-on-new-1-dollar-bill-2017/"">websites</a> in January. The story says Obama will displace George Washington, and that the public will be able to help choose from among several designs — in early 2016. That’s an easy clue that this fake story is both wrong and outdated.</p>
<p>For the record, Obama will not be going on the $1 bill, although some new bill designs (<a href=""http://time.com/4593420/harriet-tubman-20-bill-donald-trump-design/"">including a $20 featuring Harriet Tubman</a>) are in the works.

</div>]","A persistent, false claim running on numerous blogs says former President Barack Obama will replace George Washington on the $1 bill this year. The report is actually worthless.
""Barrack Obama will be on new $1 dollar bill 2017,"" reads a headline on a Jan. 26, 2017, post on TrueAmericans.me. It included a illustration (shown above) of what such a dollar may look like. The same site posted a poll asking readers whether they supported the move.
The claim was flagged by Facebook, which is trying to crack down on fabricated articles that resemble real news.
The false story, complete with the misspelling of ""Barack,"" appeared on several other websites in January. The story says Obama will displace George Washington, and that the public will be able to help choose from among several designs — in early 2016. That’s an easy clue that this fake story is both wrong and outdated.
For the record, Obama will not be going on the $1 bill, although some new bill designs (including a $20 featuring Harriet Tubman) are in the works. The U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing says there are no plans to redesign the $1 bill, because it’s seldom the target of counterfeiting.
There are also some legal roadblocks. The U.S. Treasury does not permit living people to be on currency notes, and Congress has prohibited a redesign of the single greenback in its omnibus spending measures. The vending machine lobby convinced lawmakers to leave the dollar alone, mostly because it would be expensive for vendors to upgrade bill readers to recognize cash sans Washington.",PolitiFact,"

""Election-related servers WERE NOT recently seized in Europe by the US Army contrary to #disinfo rapidly spreading across social media,"" Krebs wrote.
Scytl and Dominion share no ties, according to statements from both companies.
",PolitiFact,"
A Facebook post shares an electoral map that shows Trump beating Biden with 410 electoral votes, and says that people in Germany saw these real results before ""Dominion’s servers were seized.""
The map is not legitimate and was aired by a U.S. pro-Trump cable network. There’s also no evidence of a U.S.-election related raid or server seizure in Germany.

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<p>President Donald Trump has dismissed the testimony of a decorated Army officer in the impeachment inquiry.</p>
<p>In an <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1189527179425730560"">Oct. 30 tweet</a>, Trump described the officer as a ""Never Trumper,"" repeating the label he had used <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1189167309455331328?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Enews%7Ctwgr%5Etweet"">the day before</a>.</p>
<div class=""artembed""><a id=""see-figure-1-on-politifactcom""></a><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" data-lang=""en""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Yesterday’s Never Trumper witness could find NO Quid Pro Quo in the Transcript of the phone call. There were many people listening to the call. How come they (including the President of Ukraine) found NOTHING wrong with it. Witch Hunt!</p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1189527179425730560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">October 30, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script async="""" charset=""utf-8"" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script></div>
<p>The witness is Army Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman. Vindman listened to the July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. </p>
<p>Commentators, primarily on Fox News, have questioned Vindman’s motives. One Fox News guest said the word ""espionage"" might apply. <a href=""https://www.mediaite.com/tv/don-jr-tears-into-leftist-veteran-alex-vindman-for-testifying-against-his-father/"">Donald Trump, Jr.</a> cast him as ""a leftist.""</p>
<p>In a text of his <a href=""https://static.politico.com/69/13/cdffb8a4420a8a4d8a65439570f2/vindman-statement-final.pdf"">prepared remarks</a> to the House Intelligence Committee, Vindman wrote that he found Trump’s and Zelensky’s conversation concerning.</p>
<p>""I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government’s support of Ukraine,"" Vindman wrote. </p>
<p>He wrote that he thought that Trump’s request would politicize aid to Ukraine and ""undermine U.S. national security."" Vindman wrote that he reported his concern to the top lawyer for the National Security Council.</p>
<p>Here’s what we know about Vindman, his connection to the Ukraine investigation, and the criticisms about his motives.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Why was Vindman listening to the call?</div>
<p>Vindman joined the National Security Council in July 2018 to implement the administration’s policy on Ukraine. He reported to Fiona Hill, who in turn reported to John Bolton, Trump’s then-National Security Adviser. A Ukrainian speaker, Vindman listened to the call from the White House Situation Room, along with other security officials and members of the vice president’s staff.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Is there any evidence that Vindman opposes Trump?</div>
<p>None has emerged. The White House has provided none, and several top Republicans have defended his integrity. The third ranking House Repulican Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., decried attacks on Vindman’s motives.</p>
<p>""We're talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation, who have put their lives on the line,"" Cheney <a href=""https://www.c-span.org/video/?465857-1/house-gop-leader-mccarthy-army-officer-heard-trump-zelensky-call-wrong&amp;start=99"">said Oct. 29</a>. ""It is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation, and we should not be involved in that process."" </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">What are Vindman’s Ukrainian roots?</div>
<p>Vindman speaks Ukrainian because he was born there. After his mother died, his father left Kiev with him, his twin brother and an older brother. In 1979, they arrived in New York. Vindman was 4 years old. He and his twin went to college through the Reserve Officers Training Corps.</p>
<p>Vindman and his brother are career Army officers, and both rose to become lieutenant colonels.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">What is Vindman’s military record?</div>
<p>Vindman served in South Korea, Germany and Iraq. In 2004, he was awarded the Purple Heart after being wounded by a roadside bomb.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Army, he has served for over 20 years. In addition to the Purple Heart, his medals include two Defense Meritorious Service awards, and an Army Commendation Medal — more than 10 in total.</p>
<p>""Since 2008, I have been a Foreign Area Officer specializing in Eurasia,"" Vindman said in his committee statement. ""In this role, I have served in the United States’ embassies in Kiev, Ukraine and Moscow, Russia. In Washington, D.C., I was a politico-military affairs officer for Russia for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs where I authored the principle strategy for managing competition with Russia.""</p>
<p>He said he has served both Democrats and Republicans in a ""nonpartisan manner.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">How have Trump supporters tried to undermine Vindman?</div>
<p>The strongest criticism came on Fox News Oct. 28. Host <a href=""https://twitter.com/ndrew_lawrence/status/1189002513594441730"">Laura Ingraham</a> used conversations between Vindman and Ukrainian officials to say he was ""advising Ukraine, apparently against the president’s interests.""</p>
<p>Ingraham’s guest, John Yoo, the former White House lawyer who in 2003 gave the legal justification for torture during the Iraq War, said ""some people might call that espionage.""</p>
<p>On ""Fox and Friends,"" host Brian Kilmeade said <a href=""https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1189152265866797057"">Oct. 29</a> ""he tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine.""</p>
<p>Former Republican congressman Sean Duffy said <a href=""https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1189148524291731459"">Oct. 29</a> on CNN, ""It seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense. I don't know that he's concerned about American policy.""</p>
<p>In short, Vindman’s critics suggest that he is more interested in helping Ukraine than advancing American interests. But these arguments are speculative, and we found no objective evidence to support them.</p>

<html><body><p>Social media posts falsely suggest that Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, broke Ohio election laws when she addressed voters outside of an early voting site in Cleveland.</p>
<p>""Three strikes for Kamala’s campaign events Sunday, yells at people in line to vote in Ohio, may have broken laws,"" stated a <a href=""https://archive.is/YvmWL"">headline</a> on DJHJ Media, a conservative opinion website. A link to the article was posted on Facebook Oct. 26.</p>
<p>The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related""> our partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>
<p>The DJHJ story included a<a href=""https://twitter.com/RealJamesWoods/status/1320426001118023680?s=20""> tweet</a> by conservative actor James Woods that showed a video clip of Harris speaking Oct. 24 outside the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections building. Woods wrote ""you can literally be arrested for campaigning at a polling station."" Neither the tweet nor the DJHJ article provided proof that Harris violated state laws restricting campaigning near a polling place. </p>
<p>County election officials told PolitiFact that Harris followed the law.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Ohio law sets boundaries to prevent campaigning too close to voters</div>
<p>States often have <a href=""https://www.nass.org/sites/default/files/surveys/2020-10/state-laws-polling-place-electioneering-Oct-2020.pdf"">laws prohibiting electioneering</a> at polling sites in an effort to protect voters from feeling intimidated. These laws usually set boundaries explaining how far people campaigning must stand from voters or an election site.</p>
<p>Ohio laws state that near polling sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No person can engage in any kind of election campaigning <a href=""https://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3501.35"">within 10 feet </a>of any voter waiting in line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>U.S. flags shall be placed <a href=""http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3501.30v1"">100 feet </a>from a polling place to mark the zone where people can’t campaign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3501.35"">No person can</a> ""solicit or in any manner attempt to influence any elector in casting the elector's vote.""</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Harris spoke to a long line of voters on the first day of early in-person voting in Cuyahoga County, according to the press pool report by Buzzfeed reporter <a href=""https://twitter.com/HenryJGomez/status/1320181006587121664"">Henry Gomez</a>. There was a ""massively long line of early voters snaked around the building on Euclid Avenue, down East 30th Street and around the block,"" he wrote.</p>
<p>Harris spoke to the crowd using a cordless microphone before walking up and down the stretch of East 30th between Euclid and Chester and waving at voters. </p>
<p>In a 39-second <a href=""https://twitter.com/SethARichardson/status/1320056842828087296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1320056842828087296%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3%2Ccontainerclick_1&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cleveland.com%2Fopen%2F2020%2F10%2Fkamala-harris-stops-at-cuyahoga-county-board-of-elections-to-thank-early-voters.html"">video by Seth Richardson</a>, a Cleveland.com politics reporter, Harris didn’t mention any candidates on the ballot but gave a pep talk about the importance of voting.</p>
<p>""Thank you for voting and voting early. Your vote is your voice, your voice is your vote, There is  so much at stake — don’t let anyone ever take your power. ….  You are going to make the difference,"" she said. </p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>Harris posted <a href=""https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1320167022718783489?s=20"">an 18-second video</a> of the event on Twitter.</p>
<p>After her brief comments, she danced to some music being played across the street by a DJ who called out ""Senator! Senator! Senator!"" according to the press pool report.</p>
<p>As for the 10 foot rule, eyeballing the video, Harris appears to be more than 10 feet from the voters lined up on the sidewalk. She’s separated from the line by two traffic lanes, which are typically about 10 feet wide in urban areas.</p>
<p>We couldn’t see the flags in the <a href=""https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/10/kamala-harris-stops-at-cuyahoga-county-board-of-elections-to-thank-early-voters.html"">Twitter </a>videos of Harris marking the 100 foot barrier. But Harris was speaking to voters in a line that extended beyond the election office.</p>
<p>WKSU, public radio in Ohio, <a href=""https://www.wksu.org/government-politics/2020-10-25/huge-crowds-line-up-to-early-vote-in-stark-cuyahoga-summit-counties"">wrote</a> that Harris ""<a href=""https://www.wksu.org/government-politics/2020-10-25/line-stretches-for-blocks-on-cuyahoga-countys-first-early-voting-weekend"">made a brief stop across the street</a> from the line — and outside the 100 foot neutral zone — to thank people for voting.""</p>
<p>Tony Kaloger, Cuyahoga’s election and compliance administrator, sent us a statement about the unannounced visit by Harris to the earling voting site. </p>
<p>Several local elections employees including the director ""were outside during the majority of her stop and witnessed no violations of Ohio's electioneering laws,"" the statement said.</p>
<p>Harris did not come onto the property of the elections center. She was surrounded by Secret Service agents, and no voter or bystander was permitted to approach her. </p>
<p>""There are several officers on-site at the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections Early Vote Center tasked mainly with managing traffic and voter flow,"" the statement said. ""They will step in to assist our staff with the enforcement of the neutral zone (100 feet from the entrance or 10 feet from the voters in line when the line extends further than 100 feet) as necessary. No assistance was required during the Senator's visit.""</p>
<p>The county pointed to a two-page excerpt from a<a href=""https://www.ohiosos.gov/globalassets/elections/directives/2019/eom_12-2019/eom_ch7_2019-12-18.pdf""> 2019 directive </a>from Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, that explains where people are allowed to campaign.

</div>]","Social media posts falsely suggest that Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, broke Ohio election laws when she addressed voters outside of an early voting site in Cleveland.
""Three strikes for Kamala’s campaign events Sunday, yells at people in line to vote in Ohio, may have broken laws,"" stated a headline on DJHJ Media, a conservative opinion website. A link to the article was posted on Facebook Oct. 26.
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The DJHJ story included a tweet by conservative actor James Woods that showed a video clip of Harris speaking Oct. 24 outside the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections building. Woods wrote ""you can literally be arrested for campaigning at a polling station."" Neither the tweet nor the DJHJ article provided proof that Harris violated state laws restricting campaigning near a polling place. 
County election officials told PolitiFact that Harris followed the law.
Ohio law sets boundaries to prevent campaigning too close to voters
States often have laws prohibiting electioneering at polling sites in an effort to protect voters from feeling intimidated. These laws usually set boundaries explaining how far people campaigning must stand from voters or an election site.
Ohio laws state that near polling sites:


No person can engage in any kind of election campaigning within 10 feet of any voter waiting in line.


U.S. flags shall be placed 100 feet from a polling place to mark the zone where people can’t campaign.


No person can ""solicit or in any manner attempt to influence any elector in casting the elector's vote.""


Harris spoke to a long line of voters on the first day of early in-person voting in Cuyahoga County, according to the press pool report by Buzzfeed reporter Henry Gomez. There was a ""massively long line of early voters snaked around the building on Euclid Avenue, down East 30th Street and around the block,"" he wrote.
Harris spoke to the crowd using a cordless microphone before walking up and down the stretch of East 30th between Euclid and Chester and waving at voters. 
In a 39-second video by Seth Richardson, a Cleveland.com politics reporter, Harris didn’t mention any candidates on the ballot but gave a pep talk about the importance of voting.
""Thank you for voting and voting early. Your vote is your voice, your voice is your vote, There is  so much at stake — don’t let anyone ever take your power. ….  You are going to make the difference,"" she said.

Brain aneurysms are a “serious and common COVID-19 mRNA vaccine injury in young people.”












By Loreben Tuquero • April 25, 2023







Harris posted an 18-second video of the event on Twitter.
After her brief comments, she danced to some music being played across the street by a DJ who called out ""Senator! Senator! Senator!"" according to the press pool report.
As for the 10 foot rule, eyeballing the video, Harris appears to be more than 10 feet from the voters lined up on the sidewalk. She’s separated from the line by two traffic lanes, which are typically about 10 feet wide in urban areas.
We couldn’t see the flags in the Twitter videos of Harris marking the 100 foot barrier. But Harris was speaking to voters in a line that extended beyond the election office.
WKSU, public radio in Ohio, wrote that Harris ""made a brief stop across the street from the line — and outside the 100 foot neutral zone — to thank people for voting.""
Tony Kaloger, Cuyahoga’s election and compliance administrator, sent us a statement about the unannounced visit by Harris to the earling voting site. 
Several local elections employees including the director ""were outside during the majority of her stop and witnessed no violations of Ohio's electioneering laws,"" the statement said.
Harris did not come onto the property of the elections center. She was surrounded by Secret Service agents, and no voter or bystander was permitted to approach her. 
""There are several officers on-site at the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections Early Vote Center tasked mainly with managing traffic and voter flow,"" the statement said. ""They will step in to assist our staff with the enforcement of the neutral zone (100 feet from the entrance or 10 feet from the voters in line when the line extends further than 100 feet) as necessary. No assistance was required during the Senator's visit.""
The county pointed to a two-page excerpt from a 2019 directive from Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, that explains where people are allowed to campaign. Part of that directive says:
""Nothing in Ohio’s election laws prohibit a person or entity from campaigning, displaying campaign material, or distributing food outside of the neutral zone of a polling location (i.e., outside of the flags marking the 100 foot barrier or beyond 10 feet from any elector waiting in line to vote, if the line to vote extends beyond the flags).""
Sabrina Singh, a spokesperson for Harris, said Harris ""stood behind the 100 foot boundary line beyond the neutral zone.""
",PolitiFact,"
A headline in a story posted on Facebook stated that Harris ""may have broken laws"" when she campaigned outside a voting site in Ohio.
A county election official said that Harris did not violate laws against electioneering near a polling site. Police officers were on site during the visit by Harris and are allowed to help election officials enforce the neutral zone, but the county said that wasn’t required.

N.C. Gov. Pat McCrory, under fire on HB2, says Human Rights Campaign is 'more powerful than the NRA'
</h2>
</header>
<div adbridg-ad-class=""mobileinterstitial""></div>
<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>When one thinks of the country’s most powerful lobbying groups, acronyms like NRA, AIPAC and AARP spring to mind. So do phrases like Big Pharma, Big Oil and Wall Street.</p>
<p>During an appearance April 17 on NBC’s ""Meet The Press,"" North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory made the argument that the Human Rights Campaign is also among the most powerful lobbies in the United States.</p>
<p>""The Human Rights Council, my gosh, they’re more powerful than the NRA,"" McCrory said, meaning the Human Rights Campaign and the National Rifle Association.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Campaign, or HRC, is a major player in the opposition to North Carolina’s controversial new law, House Bill 2, which limits LGBT rights in public accommodations — and which McCrory was on national television to defend.</p>
<p>""They are putting on a lot of pressure instead of having good dialogue,"" McCrory said.</p>
<p>The HRC is the country’s largest gay rights group. It has led the charge for gay marriage and for the types of LGBT discrimination protections that HB2 prohibited cities in North Carolina from making.</p>
<p>But has the group really eclipsed the NRA, an oft-cited stereotype of a powerful lobbying group that can shape public policy and opinion?</p>
<p>McCrory says it has. And in the last few days, that claim has been picked up as a talking point by supporters of HB2.</p>
<p><strong>Measuring political power</strong></p>
<p>It would be big news if McCrory was right. Debates over gay rights, as with gun rights, are a large part of modern political discourse.</p>
<p>We don’t know what criteria McCrory was using, if any, to make his claim. ""Meet The Press"" host Chuck Todd didn’t ask him to elaborate. When we asked McCrory’s campaign about his rationale, spokesman Ricky Diaz called it a ""ridiculous question"" and declined to answer.</p>
<p>We also asked both the HRC and the NRA whether they agreed with McCrory. The NRA did not respond, and the HRC declined to answer.</p>
<p>There are many ways to measure a group’s strength. We asked an expert, UNC-Chapel Hill political science professor Frank Baumgartner, who has written multiple books on special interest groups and lobbying.</p>
<p>He listed three main ways to measure influence: Money and resources, ""cultural resonance"" and record of success or failure.</p>
<p>Baumgartner said he believes McCrory’s comparison is ""false or substantially exaggerated."" But let’s look into the numbers to see if they back that up.</p>
<p><strong>Money</strong></p>
<p>Money is especially important in modern politics because of the Citizens United ruling that McCrory mentioned, which allows for unlimited political spending. In 2014, according to federal tax filings, the NRA and its foundation had revenue of $356.1 million, compared with $51.2 million for the HRC and its foundation.</p>
<p>Money allows interest groups to hire lobbyists, contribute directly to politicians and political groups or take part in what’s known as outside spending – TV ads, mailers and other political initiatives.</p>
<p>In the 2014 election cycle, according to the Center For Responsive Politics, the NRA’s political spending was 7.5 times greater than the HRC’s ($36.8 million to $4.8 million).</p>
<p>In the 2012 cycle, the NRA spent five times as much ($26.9 million to $5.1 million).</p>
<p>In both cycles, the NRA spent more on lobbying than the HRC spent on lobbying, contributions and outside spending combined. For outside spending in particular, the NRA spent about $350 for every $1 the HRC spent.</p>
<p><strong>""Cultural resonance""</strong></p>
<p>How do you measure this? It sounds intangible, but there are ways to break it into specific, quantifiable pieces.</p>
<p>And in everything we looked at, the NRA came out on top.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>Membership, magazine subscriptions, Google searches, social media following and official government mentions all show the NRA’s presence is anywhere from 2 to 10 times larger than the HRC’s.</p>
<p>Both groups have magazines. The HRC’s goes to more than 350,000 homes, according to a group spokesman this week. According to the publishing group Alliance for Audited Media, the NRA’s three magazines had a combined circulation in 2015 of more than 3.5 million.</p>
<p>As for membership, both have been accused in the past of inflating their numbers. Take it with a grain of salt, but the NRA claims 4.5 million members compared with 1.5 million for the HRC.</p>
<p>The NRA also has a larger audience on social media – 4.8 million Facebook likes and 345,000 Twitter followers, compared with 2.3 million Facebook likes and 529,000 Twitter followers for the HRC.</p>
<p>We also compared online searches, which indicate how interested people are in learning about the groups. When their Google searches over the last 12 years are graphed against each other, the HRC’s results show up as an almost flat line hovering just above 0.</p>
<p>We used Google Trends to aggregate numerous terms related to both groups and map their relative popularity as compared with all other searches each month. The NRA is in red and the HRC is in blue.</p>
<p>Even the HRC’s best month didn’t surpass the NRA’s worst month.</p>
<p><img alt=""Screen Shot 2016-04-19 at 3.25.55 PM.png"" src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3ytC3GQwCW1yRaNRjOBW93DzSFFzeBlAHJMFSHTjY0Q6q51qga7zgMZ-nq8zmgDfCcyh7ppLWoZW-BFyg4vLfWmMrYkVNU9x7XVKWFOw-a8TTXgS3OOedFzXr2q2LTPiJOYc12YN"" style=""border:none; height:191px; width:624px""/></p>
<p>We also counted how often they’re mentioned in congressional hearing transcripts and other documents listed by the U.S. Government Publishing Office search engine –1,408 results for ""National Rifle Association"" and 393 for ""Human Rights Campaign.""</p>
<p><strong>Reputation and success</strong></p>
<p>Baumgartner said he thinks this was the point McCrory was trying to make – on a group’s ""ability to push public policy in a direction the group prefers.""</p>
<p>And again, Baumgartner said, the HRC doesn’t quite stack up.</p>
<p>""I'd say Human Rights Campaign has had some success,"" he said. ""But no, they would not compare to the long-run success of groups such as the NRA, the Realtors, the petroleum industry, the Chamber of Commerce and many others.""</p>
<p>The NRA is famous for its clout and success in Congress. The HRC, on the other hand, has achieved most of its biggest victories – gay marriage, gay adoption rights and the invalidation of anti-sodomy laws – at the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The HRC has existed since 1980. For most of that time, one of its top priorities has been a federal LGBT anti-discrimination law.</p>
<p>Efforts to pass such laws state-by-state have been mostly unsuccessful, as we explored in <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2016/apr/13/paul-skip-stam/nc-rep-stam-says-states-controversial-new-law-isnt/"">a previous fact check</a>. On the national level, friendly legislators have introduced the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, ENDA, in nearly every Congress since 1994.</p>
<p>It has failed each time, despite polling that shows about three quarters of Americans support such laws.</p>
<p>The NRA has done the opposite, persuading Congress to repeatedly kill legislation that has even broader public support than ENDA does.</p>
<p>Even though about 90 percent of Americans support background checks on gun buyers – <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2015/oct/05/jeremy-bird/jeremy-bird-says-90-percent-americans-want-mandato/"">previous</a> <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/apr/04/lee-leffingwell/lee-leffingwell-says-polls-show-90-percent-america/"">PolitiFact</a> <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/jan/05/laura-ingraham/laura-ingraham-say-claim-90-support-gun-background/"">rulings</a> have found a range of 85 to 93 percent – the federal Fix Gun Checks Act has been voted down several times since 2011. It would allow for universal background checks, and the NRA is <a href=""http://thehill.com/opinion/op-ed/288877-a-universally-bad-idea"">strongly opposed to it</a>.</p>
<p>As for the HRC, it hasn’t been totally unsuccessful in Congress. The group successfully pushed for a 2009 law that <a href=""http://www.hrc.org/resources/hate-crimes-law"">expanded federal hate crime definitions</a> to include LGBT status.</p>
<p>And what about outside of government, in the corporate world? It’s undeniable that the HRC’s influence there is growing.</p>
<p>The group started ranking how ""LGBT friendly"" companies were <a href=""https://www.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/CorporateEqualityIndex_2002.pdf"">in 2002</a> in what it calls its Corporate Equality Index. About a dozen received a perfect score that year. <a href=""http://www.hrc.org/campaigns/corporate-equality-index"">In 2016</a>, more than 400 companies did.</p>
<p>And many businesses have followed the HRC in criticizing North Carolina over HB2. But that hasn’t meant much so far. Key legislators have said they have <a href=""http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article72969472.html"">no plans to repeal HB2</a> or make major changes to it, despite the pressure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the NRA has seen many of its initiatives passed in North Carolina, like 2013 law that <a href=""http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H937v6.pdf"">loosened restrictions</a> on concealed carry.</p>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>McCrory said the main group against HB2, the Human Rights Campaign, is ""more powerful than the NRA."" It’s a strong claim, given the NRA’s reputation for power and influence, and even the HRC spokesman was unwilling to embrace it.</p>
<p>That’s not to say the HRC isn’t powerful. It’s a multimillion-dollar organization and the country’s largest gay rights group. But it doesn’t have the resources, adherents or success rate that the NRA does. In every way we tried to define influence, the HRC doesn’t even come close to the NRA’s level of power.</p>
<p>We rate this claim False.</p>

</div>]","When one thinks of the country’s most powerful lobbying groups, acronyms like NRA, AIPAC and AARP spring to mind. So do phrases like Big Pharma, Big Oil and Wall Street.
During an appearance April 17 on NBC’s ""Meet The Press,"" North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory made the argument that the Human Rights Campaign is also among the most powerful lobbies in the United States.
""The Human Rights Council, my gosh, they’re more powerful than the NRA,"" McCrory said, meaning the Human Rights Campaign and the National Rifle Association.
The Human Rights Campaign, or HRC, is a major player in the opposition to North Carolina’s controversial new law, House Bill 2, which limits LGBT rights in public accommodations — and which McCrory was on national television to defend.
""They are putting on a lot of pressure instead of having good dialogue,"" McCrory said.
The HRC is the country’s largest gay rights group. It has led the charge for gay marriage and for the types of LGBT discrimination protections that HB2 prohibited cities in North Carolina from making.
But has the group really eclipsed the NRA, an oft-cited stereotype of a powerful lobbying group that can shape public policy and opinion?
McCrory says it has. And in the last few days, that claim has been picked up as a talking point by supporters of HB2.
Measuring political power
It would be big news if McCrory was right. Debates over gay rights, as with gun rights, are a large part of modern political discourse.
We don’t know what criteria McCrory was using, if any, to make his claim. ""Meet The Press"" host Chuck Todd didn’t ask him to elaborate. When we asked McCrory’s campaign about his rationale, spokesman Ricky Diaz called it a ""ridiculous question"" and declined to answer.
We also asked both the HRC and the NRA whether they agreed with McCrory. The NRA did not respond, and the HRC declined to answer.
There are many ways to measure a group’s strength. We asked an expert, UNC-Chapel Hill political science professor Frank Baumgartner, who has written multiple books on special interest groups and lobbying.
He listed three main ways to measure influence: Money and resources, ""cultural resonance"" and record of success or failure.
Baumgartner said he believes McCrory’s comparison is ""false or substantially exaggerated."" But let’s look into the numbers to see if they back that up.
Money
Money is especially important in modern politics because of the Citizens United ruling that McCrory mentioned, which allows for unlimited political spending. In 2014, according to federal tax filings, the NRA and its foundation had revenue of $356.1 million, compared with $51.2 million for the HRC and its foundation.
Money allows interest groups to hire lobbyists, contribute directly to politicians and political groups or take part in what’s known as outside spending – TV ads, mailers and other political initiatives.
In the 2014 election cycle, according to the Center For Responsive Politics, the NRA’s political spending was 7.5 times greater than the HRC’s ($36.8 million to $4.8 million).
In the 2012 cycle, the NRA spent five times as much ($26.9 million to $5.1 million).
In both cycles, the NRA spent more on lobbying than the HRC spent on lobbying, contributions and outside spending combined. For outside spending in particular, the NRA spent about $350 for every $1 the HRC spent.
""Cultural resonance""
How do you measure this? It sounds intangible, but there are ways to break it into specific, quantifiable pieces.
And in everything we looked at, the NRA came out on top.

A Minnesota lawmaker introduced a bill that would make it “illegal to discriminate against child rapists.”












By Loreben Tuquero • May 3, 2023







Membership, magazine subscriptions, Google searches, social media following and official government mentions all show the NRA’s presence is anywhere from 2 to 10 times larger than the HRC’s.
Both groups have magazines. The HRC’s goes to more than 350,000 homes, according to a group spokesman this week. According to the publishing group Alliance for Audited Media, the NRA’s three magazines had a combined circulation in 2015 of more than 3.5 million.
As for membership, both have been accused in the past of inflating their numbers. Take it with a grain of salt, but the NRA claims 4.5 million members compared with 1.5 million for the HRC.
The NRA also has a larger audience on social media – 4.8 million Facebook likes and 345,000 Twitter followers, compared with 2.3 million Facebook likes and 529,000 Twitter followers for the HRC.
We also compared online searches, which indicate how interested people are in learning about the groups. When their Google searches over the last 12 years are graphed against each other, the HRC’s results show up as an almost flat line hovering just above 0.
We used Google Trends to aggregate numerous terms related to both groups and map their relative popularity as compared with all other searches each month. The NRA is in red and the HRC is in blue.
Even the HRC’s best month didn’t surpass the NRA’s worst month.

We also counted how often they’re mentioned in congressional hearing transcripts and other documents listed by the U.S. Government Publishing Office search engine –1,408 results for ""National Rifle Association"" and 393 for ""Human Rights Campaign.""
Reputation and success
Baumgartner said he thinks this was the point McCrory was trying to make – on a group’s ""ability to push public policy in a direction the group prefers.""
And again, Baumgartner said, the HRC doesn’t quite stack up.
""I'd say Human Rights Campaign has had some success,"" he said. ""But no, they would not compare to the long-run success of groups such as the NRA, the Realtors, the petroleum industry, the Chamber of Commerce and many others.""
The NRA is famous for its clout and success in Congress. The HRC, on the other hand, has achieved most of its biggest victories – gay marriage, gay adoption rights and the invalidation of anti-sodomy laws – at the Supreme Court.
The HRC has existed since 1980. For most of that time, one of its top priorities has been a federal LGBT anti-discrimination law.
Efforts to pass such laws state-by-state have been mostly unsuccessful, as we explored in a previous fact check. On the national level, friendly legislators have introduced the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, ENDA, in nearly every Congress since 1994.
It has failed each time, despite polling that shows about three quarters of Americans support such laws.
The NRA has done the opposite, persuading Congress to repeatedly kill legislation that has even broader public support than ENDA does.
Even though about 90 percent of Americans support background checks on gun buyers – previous PolitiFact rulings have found a range of 85 to 93 percent – the federal Fix Gun Checks Act has been voted down several times since 2011. It would allow for universal background checks, and the NRA is strongly opposed to it.
As for the HRC, it hasn’t been totally unsuccessful in Congress. The group successfully pushed for a 2009 law that expanded federal hate crime definitions to include LGBT status.
And what about outside of government, in the corporate world? It’s undeniable that the HRC’s influence there is growing.
The group started ranking how ""LGBT friendly"" companies were in 2002 in what it calls its Corporate Equality Index. About a dozen received a perfect score that year. In 2016, more than 400 companies did.
And many businesses have followed the HRC in criticizing North Carolina over HB2. But that hasn’t meant much so far. Key legislators have said they have no plans to repeal HB2 or make major changes to it, despite the pressure.
On the other hand, the NRA has seen many of its initiatives passed in North Carolina, like 2013 law that loosened restrictions on concealed carry.
<strong",PolitiFact,"
McCrory said the main group against HB2, the Human Rights Campaign, is ""more powerful than the NRA."" It’s a strong claim, given the NRA’s reputation for power and influence, and even the HRC spokesman was unwilling to embrace it.
That’s not to say the HRC isn’t powerful. It’s a multimillion-dollar organization and the country’s largest gay rights group. But it doesn’t have the resources, adherents or success rate that the NRA does. In every way we tried to define influence, the HRC doesn’t even come close to the NRA’s level of power.
We rate this claim False.

<p>Trump touted his decision at a cabinet meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>""I knocked out the CSRs (cost-sharing reductions),"" Trump <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/10/16/remarks-president-trump-cabinet-meeting"">said Oct. 16</a>.

<p>At first, Trump seemed at ease with the compromise.</p>

In reality, the money pays the insurers for payments they make to health care providers. It is a pass-through. Every health care economist we reached said if the companies don’t gain any cash from the transaction, then there is no gift, no bailout or whatever term one might use.
The one grain of truth is that anything that makes insurance more affordable increases sales, even if by a small amount.
We rate this claim Mostly False.

<p>""What counts as misconduct is defined differently in different states, and it is a relatively high bar in some places,"" Garden said. ""Still, I think most unemployment agencies and courts would agree that willfully violating a workplace safety rule — including a vaccination requirement — is sufficient misconduct to make a worker ineligible for unemployment insurance.""</p>
<p>Garden said she is not aware of any state that awards unemployment benefits to workers fired for significant misconduct. According to a <a href=""https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/verify/employer-requires-vaccine-denied-unemployment-for-refusing-fact-check/65-798b5edb-69f5-447d-9e3f-d61df9b3bd2a?fbclid=IwAR3WIyde-zaIwRF_fGAu1PkP5fbjc82JxEnwTg5SoZW8DD5UuI9a0nZtxrs"">recent report from WUSA9</a>, a TV station in Washington, D.C., workers who get terminated for rejecting company vaccination policies would likely be denied unemployment benefits under the laws in Washington, Virginia and Maryland. TV stations in <a href=""https://www.wfmynews2.com/article/news/local/it-could-disqualify-them-from-receiving-benefits-employees-who-quit-triad-hospitals-requiring-vaccination-ineligible-for-unemployment/83-0102df1b-e798-469a-b481-542d11753ed5"">North Carolina</a> and <a href=""https://upnorthlive.com/news/local/getting-fired-for-vaccine-refusalis-it-legal-can-you-get-unemployment"">Michigan</a> reported that workers there could expect the same.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/1415446/download"">Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel</a> advised in July that employers can mandate vaccines as a <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-business-health-coronavirus-pandemic-df4d71cd3d3a6b48ce84f959c8b40da0"">""condition of employment.""</a> The legal opinion clarified that U.S. law ""does not prohibit public or private entities from imposing vaccination requirements for a vaccine that is subject to an emergency use authorization"" — an argument sometimes pushed by people opposed to vaccines.</p>

<p>""Employers generally have wide discretion to require safety measures,"" said Catherine Fisk, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law. In some states like <a href=""https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/07/26/california-implements-first-in-the-nation-measures-to-encourage-state-employees-and-health-care-workers-to-get-vaccinated/"">California</a>, the law itself has vaccine requirements for certain workers, such as those in health care.</p>
<p>Some workers represented by a union and covered by a collective bargaining agreement might have more leverage, said Harper, the Boston University law professor. Even then, the union would have considerable power to decide how to handle a worker grievance over such a firing.</p>
<p>""Some unions are negotiating over this,"" Fisk said. After Tyson Foods, a food corporation, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/business/vaccine-mandate-employees-microsoft.html"">announced</a> a vaccine mandate recently, for example, a union leader said in a statement that the union will be meeting with the company to discuss the mandate and ""ensure that the rights of these workers are protected.""</p>
<p>The Facebook post is also inaccurate as it pertains to people who quit their jobs, Garden said, since there are some specific scenarios in which a person could quit and be entitled to benefits. This could be the case if a worker quit because they were medically exempt from a company’s vaccine mandate but were not provided with a reasonable accommodation, Garden said.</p>
<p>Overall, people who rely on the post and follow its guidance ""are going to receive a very unpleasant surprise when they are denied unemployment benefits,"" Garden said.</p>

Employers have latitude
Unemployment payments are provided to Americans who wind up out of a job through no fault of their own, such as when a business closes or downsizes. 
Each state sets its own guidelines for determining eligibility, including for fired workers. But in many states, a person who was let go for misconduct can be denied benefits.
In Alabama, for example, a state with one of the lowest vaccination rates, a state handbook says unemployment payments can be delayed or disqualified for workers fired ""for misconduct in connection with the work,"" which can include ""failure to obey an employer’s work rules and policies,"" ""endangering the safety of others"" and ""disregarding orders or instructions.""
Experts agreed that violating a policy requiring vaccinations against COVID-19 would likely disqualify a fired employee from getting benefits, unless the worker was exempted for medical or religious reasons covered by federal law.

<p style=""margin-left:40px""><strong>Reporter Maggie Haberman</strong>: ""And if not?""</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px""><strong>Trump</strong>: ""Well, I’m not saying if not. I’m saying, right now there are many countries that have not fulfilled their obligations to us.""</p>
<p>So in that interview, Trump argued other NATO countries had to ""fulfill their obligations"" to receive the United States’ military aid. Asked to clarify what would happen to countries who hadn’t paid, he demurred.</p>
<p>In May 2016, Trump also <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/05/23/donald-trump-defends-his-national-security-positions-as-hillary-clinton-attacks/"">told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> that when other NATO nations ""don’t pay up, they’ve backed out of their obligations, then we no longer have an obligation to defend them.""</p>
<p>Trump said he did not want to get out of NATO, but wanted ""the countries of NATO to pay us.""</p>
<p>There’s a problem with the way Trump has talked about NATO country payments.</p>
<p>""No one in NATO actually ‘pays us’ to defend them, as Trump repeatedly claims, nor is there any obligation to do so,"" said Ivo H. Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who previously served as ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>""Our commitment to come to our allies' defense -- and theirs to ours -- isn't in return for any payment,"" Daalder said. ""It is an unconditional treaty obligation every ally entered into freely when they signed the North Atlantic Treaty.""</p>
<p>NATO allies pay into military and civilian budgets on the basis of agreed cost shares, said Jeff Rathke, senior fellow and deputy director of the Europe Program at Center for Strategic and International Studies. And to be clear, funds are paid to NATO, not to the United States.</p>
<p>Beyond the common funding of certain capabilities, each NATO ally is also responsible for spending on its own defense, said Rathke, who served on NATO’s International Staff from 2009 to 2011. Allies are to spend at least<a href=""http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_07/20160704_160704-pr2016-116.pdf""> 2 percent</a> of their gross domestic product on defense, though many are not meeting the guideline.</p>
<p>Jorge Benitez, director of NATOSource at the Atlantic Council, says if Trump were elected president and decided not to help defend a NATO ally under attack, ""it would be the end of NATO.""</p>
<p>""This would be a very damaging blow to U.S. national security and would also hurt our alliances in other parts of the world,"" Benitez said.</p>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>Clinton said when Trump was asked if he would defend our allies, ""He said well, first he'd want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them.""</p>
<p>Trump has raised questions about other NATO nations not paying their fair share for defense. In a <em>New York Times</em> interview, Trump was asked if he would defend NATO members against an attack by Russia, and he said ""if they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes.""</p>
<p>Trump also told the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>that if allies ""don’t pay up, they’ve backed out of their obligations, then we no longer have an obligation to defend them.""</p>

</div>]","With two weeks until Election Day, Hillary Clinton used a rally in Florida to undermine Donald Trump’s reputation as a prospective commander-in-chief.
Clinton said Trump in a tweet called efforts against terrorists in Mosul ""a total disaster"" and said the United States was ""looking dumb.""
""He's proving once again he is unqualified to be commander in chief of our military,"" Clinton said Oct. 25 in Coconut Creek, Fla. ""Here's another example: He was asked if he would defend our allies. He said well, first he'd want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them.""
Has Trump said he would first check who’s making payments before defending them?
In media interviews, he has said there’s no obligation to defend them if they don’t pay up. Trump’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

Clinton is talking about Trump’s comments about NATO during the campaign.

NATO invoked Article 5 for the first time after the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the United States.
To back Clinton’s claim, her campaign directed us to a July 2016 New York Times interview with Trump on foreign policy. Trump was asked about defending small Baltic States that have recently joined NATO against Russia, such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

"""More astronauts have been to the moon than farmers who paid the inheritance tax in 2013.""",Bill Maher,2015-04-17T00:00:00Z,http://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/apr/23/bill-maher/bill-maher-says-more-americans-have-been-moon-farm/,Bill Maher says more Americans have been to the moon than farmers who paid the estate tax in 2013,2016-05-16T19:51:52Z,en,"[<div class=""t-row__center"">

Bill Maher says more Americans have been to the moon than farmers who paid the estate tax in 2013
</h2>
</header>
<div adbridg-ad-class=""mobileinterstitial""></div>
<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>Liberal comedian Bill Maher made an out-of-this-world comparison to poke a hole in the Republican argument that the estate tax threatens the livelihoods of ""family farmers.""</p>
<p>Of 5,000 Americans who paid the estate tax in 2013, ""20 farmers paid it,"" Maher said on his April 17, 2015, show. ""Twenty-four Americans have been to the moon.""</p>
<p>""More astronauts have been to the moon than farmers who paid the inheritance tax in 2013.""</p>
<p>There obviously is no relation between the number of farmers paying the estate tax and the number of Americans who went to the moon, but as a point of trivia, Maher’s claim is an intriguing one. A reader asked us to ""do the magic that you do,"" which is determining whether Maher’s point is accurate.</p>
<p><strong>One small step for fact-checkers ...</strong></p>
<p>Caveat No 1: Maher is using the number of astronauts who have been to the vicinity of the moon, not just the number of moonwalkers.</p>
<p>Twelve Americans have walked the moon’s surface over six Apollo missions, starting with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planting an American flag in 1969. (If you’re not sure about whether the lunar landing really happened, you won’t like this fact-check, but you may enjoy these bona fide <a href=""http://moon.nasa.gov/moonmisconceptions.cfm"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>moon misconceptions</u></a>.)</p>
<p>Add another 12 American astronauts who orbited the moon but did not walk on it, and you get  24.</p>
<p>NASA chief historian William Barry said the 24 Americans is a solid figure in that it doesn’t double count Americans who made more than one lunar trip. ""There were several astronauts who flew to the Moon and orbited it on one mission and then were lucky enough to go back and land on it on a later mission,"" Barry said.</p>
<p>Jim Lovell, for instance, made two trips to the moon in Apollo 8 and Apollo 13, but he never walked on it. (In this Smithsonian picture, Lovell and his crew emerge from the U.S.S. Iwo Jima after landing the spacecraft <a href=""http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/apollo/apo13.html"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>Apollo 13</u></a> in the South Pacific.)</p>
<p><img alt=""smithsonian1.jpg"" src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/j-Qm12LX1xkcKgn4baVOM1zUeeSkbTxfYdi4IOfZ9DecEzRMyaP2J7C136G1TvDbEJNFM7ElNFsTvR7Y9U4V3ID9TbRVeiGadtE2y9ohsCWEfsTNWm33R7vCrnCERo3d6w2jZHU"" style=""-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:389px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:497px""/></p>
<p><strong>… One giant leap for the truth </strong></p>
<p>What Maher calls the ""inheritance tax"" and what Republicans call the ""death tax"" is more accurately described as the estate tax. Some wealthy families face this tax when they pass on assets (cash, land, homes, stocks, etc.) to heirs after death.</p>
<p>Most estates do not owe estate taxes. It affects about 5,500 Americans whose estates exceed the exemption limit of <a href=""http://www.cbpp.org/research/ten-facts-you-should-know-about-the-federal-estate-tax?fa=view&amp;id=2655"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>$5.43 million per person</u></a>. If the estate is worth more than that, an heir could pay a tax rate up to 40 percent on the value of the estate above that limit.</p>
<p>Even though it doesn’t affect all that many people, it brings in big bucks for the government. Repealing it would cost about $270 billion over the next decade, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.</p>
<p>In the week ahead of Maher’s April 17 show, House Republicans approved <a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/publication/50100"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>a plan </u></a>to eliminate the estate tax, saying it ""can prove devastating to families — forcing them to sell land, lay off workers, and even shut down entirely.""</p>
<p>So did this tax really affect just ""20 farmers"" in 2013, as Maher said?</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>The number comes from an estimate by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution.</p>
<p>Tax Policy Center economists wanted to get an idea of how the tax would affect estates, including those with farm and business assets, in 2013.

<p>They defined family farms and businesses as estates having farm or business assets less than $5 million and half of the estate. These farms and businesses had taxable returns and total assets between $5 million and up $10 million.</p>
<p>""It’s a definition that hones in on small farms and business — the most relevant in responding to the myth that many small farms and small businesses must be liquidated to pay estate tax,"" said Brandon DeBot, a research assistant at the federal fiscal policy division of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.</p>

</div>]","Liberal comedian Bill Maher made an out-of-this-world comparison to poke a hole in the Republican argument that the estate tax threatens the livelihoods of ""family farmers.""
Of 5,000 Americans who paid the estate tax in 2013, ""20 farmers paid it,"" Maher said on his April 17, 2015, show. ""Twenty-four Americans have been to the moon.""
""More astronauts have been to the moon than farmers who paid the inheritance tax in 2013.""
There obviously is no relation between the number of farmers paying the estate tax and the number of Americans who went to the moon, but as a point of trivia, Maher’s claim is an intriguing one. A reader asked us to ""do the magic that you do,"" which is determining whether Maher’s point is accurate.
One small step for fact-checkers ...
Caveat No 1: Maher is using the number of astronauts who have been to the vicinity of the moon, not just the number of moonwalkers.
Twelve Americans have walked the moon’s surface over six Apollo missions, starting with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planting an American flag in 1969. (If you’re not sure about whether the lunar landing really happened, you won’t like this fact-check, but you may enjoy these bona fide moon misconceptions.)
Add another 12 American astronauts who orbited the moon but did not walk on it, and you get  24.
NASA chief historian William Barry said the 24 Americans is a solid figure in that it doesn’t double count Americans who made more than one lunar trip. ""There were several astronauts who flew to the Moon and orbited it on one mission and then were lucky enough to go back and land on it on a later mission,"" Barry said.
Jim Lovell, for instance, made two trips to the moon in Apollo 8 and Apollo 13, but he never walked on it. (In this Smithsonian picture, Lovell and his crew emerge from the U.S.S. Iwo Jima after landing the spacecraft Apollo 13 in the South Pacific.)

… One giant leap for the truth 
What Maher calls the ""inheritance tax"" and what Republicans call the ""death tax"" is more accurately described as the estate tax. Some wealthy families face this tax when they pass on assets (cash, land, homes, stocks, etc.) to heirs after death.
Most estates do not owe estate taxes. It affects about 5,500 Americans whose estates exceed the exemption limit of $5.43 million per person. If the estate is worth more than that, an heir could pay a tax rate up to 40 percent on the value of the estate above that limit.
Even though it doesn’t affect all that many people, it brings in big bucks for the government. Repealing it would cost about $270 billion over the next decade, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.
In the week ahead of Maher’s April 17 show, House Republicans approved a plan to eliminate the estate tax, saying it ""can prove devastating to families — forcing them to sell land, lay off workers, and even shut down entirely.""
So did this tax really affect just ""20 farmers"" in 2013, as Maher said?

“Joe Biden was older on his first day as president than Ronald Reagan was on his last day.”












By Louis Jacobson • May 1, 2023







The number comes from an estimate by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution.
Tax Policy Center economists wanted to get an idea of how the tax would affect estates, including those with farm and business assets, in 2013. All of their numbers are estimates based on the center’s estate tax model.
They defined family farms and businesses as estates having farm or business assets less than $5 million and half of the estate. These farms and businesses had taxable returns and total assets between $5 million and up $10 million.
""It’s a definition that hones in on small farms and business — the most relevant in responding to the myth that many small farms and small businesses must be liquidated to pay estate tax,"" said Brandon DeBot, a research assistant at the federal fiscal policy division of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Using the Tax Policy Center’s model, an estimated 20 small farms and small businesses would have had to pay the estate tax in 2013, amounting to a total of $6.9 million of tax with an average tax rate of 4.9 percent. So that’s not just small farms, it’s small farms and small businesses, which might not be a farm.
Caveat No. 2: The number of farms and businesses is probably not exactly 20, as it is an estimate rounded to the nearest multiple of 10. That means the number is anywhere from 16-24.
Caveat No. 3: Maher talked about ""family farmers,"" addressing the Republican argument about the plight of farmers who could lose their livelihood because of the estate tax. But family farms can be big farms, and that’s where things get more complicated.
Maher set up his comparison by discussing the plight of family farmers, but then later dropped the word ""family."" That one word is important.
The Tax Policy Center broadened the scope to include all farm and business estates, regardless of size, with at least half of their value from farm business activity. By that method, 120 farm and business estates would have had to pay the estate tax in 2013, said Roberton Williams, a Tax Policy Center fellow who worked on the model.
Alan D. Viard, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who studies federal tax and budget policy, says the the estate tax has a lot of flaws, but the effect on farmers is ""just not the right grounds to criticize this tax."" Maher’s point was strong, he said.
In 2001, House Republicans voted to repeal the ""death tax."" New York Times reporter David Cay Johnston scoured 1999 IRS filings, phoned the American Farm Bureau Federation, and interviewed farmers in effort to find examples of working farmers who lost their farms because of estate taxes. He found none, writing that the reality of who is bitten by the estate tax ""is different from the mythology,"" as ""the overwhelming majority of beneficiaries are the heirs of people who made their fortunes through their businesses and investments in securities and real estate.""
And in 2001, the estate tax was more robust than it is now, with a lower exemption level of $675,000 and a higher top tax rate of 55 percent.
""It is a small number, bottom line,"" Williams said. ""They’re going to be the exception rather than the rule.""
<strong",PolitiFact,"
Maher compared 24 American astronauts who ""have been to the moon"" to 20 farmers whom he said were the only ones to pay the estate tax.
His count for astronauts who ""have been to the moon"" is reasonable, counting both American moonwalkers and those who have flown in its orbit during various Apollo missions.
The larger point about only 20 farmers paying the estate tax is a little more complicated. A 2013 nonpartisan study found 20 small farms and small businesses faced the estate tax in 2013.
Maher referred to ""family farms"" in setting up his claim. Saying small farms would have been better. And he dropped ""family"" in later references.
Experts said Maher generally could have been more careful in his wording, but that his bit of trivia largely checks out, as does his point that the estate tax affects very few small farmers. We rate his claim Mostly True.

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>The U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin, featuring incumbent Republican Ron Johnson and Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes, is full of sharp contrasts.</p>
<p>And sharp claims.</p>
<p>Consider this Aug. 17 tweet from Barnes, in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court decision throwing out Roe v. Wade: </p>
<p>""Ron Johnson just came out in favor of a federal abotion ban. We knew this was coming … he is doing everything he can to drag us back in time and strip women of their rights and freedoms."" </p>
<p>For this check, we’ll focus on the first portion of the tweet: Does Johnson, who is seeking a third term, back a federal abortion ban? And did he announce such a position recently?</p>
<p>We’ll start with a truism of politics: The closer you get to an election, particularly a hotly contested one, the stronger statements are framed — and often the more facts get lost in the matter.</p>
<p>In this case, there should be little surprise that the two sides differ on what the word ""ban"" means. </p>
<p>But there’s little question that Johnson’s position has not suddenly changed dramatically.</p>
<p>Let’s dig in.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">A look at Johnson’s record on the issue</div>
<p>The Supreme Court decision, of course, undid the constitutional right to an abortion granted under the Roe v. Wade ruling, sending the matter to the states. </p>
<p>Abortion-rights supports say one way to address the situation now is to pass a measure permitting abortions — in effect, making the standards under Roe part of federal law. Abortion foes, meanwhile, have long worked to pass federal laws limiting abortion.</p>
<p>When we asked Barnes’ campaign to back up the claim, a spokesperson pointed to several things, including those GOP-led efforts and Johnson’s support for them.</p>
<p>First, they cited a 2019 bill that called for prison time for performing or attempting an abortion after a fetus reaches 20 weeks or more, except in cases in which pregnancy endangers the mother’s life or results from rape or incest.</p>
<p>Johnson was a co-sponsor of the bill, according to <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/160/cosponsors"">Congress.gov</a> and voted in favor of it on Feb. 25, 2020, according to <a href=""https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1162/vote_116_2_00057.htm"">Senate records</a>. According to Congressional records, Johnson also supported similar bills in <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-bill/2103/cosponsors?r=13&amp;s=6"">2012</a>, <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1670/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Pain-Capable+Unborn+Child+Protection+Act%22%2C%22Pain-Capable%22%2C%22Unborn%22%2C%22Child%22%2C%22Protection%22%2C%22Act%22%5D%7D&amp;r=10&amp;s=2"">2013</a>, <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1553/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Pain-Capable+Unborn+Child+Protection+Act%22%2C%22Pain-Capable%22%2C%22Unborn%22%2C%22Child%22%2C%22Protection%22%2C%22Act%22%5D%7D&amp;r=7&amp;s=2"">2015</a>, <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1922/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Pain-Capable+Unborn+Child+Protection+Act%22%2C%22Pain-Capable%22%2C%22Unborn%22%2C%22Child%22%2C%22Protection%22%2C%22Act%22%5D%7D&amp;r=5&amp;s=2"">2017</a>, <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2311/cosponsors?r=6&amp;s=2"">2018</a> and <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/61/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Pain-Capable+Unborn+Child+Protection+Act%22%2C%22Pain-Capable%22%2C%22Unborn%22%2C%22Child%22%2C%22Protection%22%2C%22Act%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1&amp;s=2"">2021</a>.</p>
<p>This is where the definition of a ban comes in.</p>
<p>The Johnson side says ""a ban is a ban is a ban."" That’s a quote from Ben Voelkel, with the Johnson campaign. In other words, unless abortion is prohibited entirely, with no exceptions, it is not a ban. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Barnes side would argue that, yes, a ban is a ban. That is, any sort of ban — even one that starts at 20 weeks of pregnancy — is still ""a ban."" </p>
<p>They note Johnson himself used the word ""ban"" in describing his support for the matter in a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTBBYboq5Ys"">May 2022 segment on Newsmax</a>: ""I signed on to a national bill that would have banned abortions after 20 weeks."" (That four-second clip is even featured on the YouTube page for the Barnes campaign)</p>
<p>But consider the remainder of the Barnes tweet for context. He says of Johnson, ""He is doing everything he can to drag us back in time and strip women of their rights and freedoms.""</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>The phrasing leaves the impression that Johnson would ban abortion entirely, or at least lets readers reach that conclusion. </p>
<p>The bottom line: Barnes does not fully make his case on this point.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">What has happened since the Supreme Court decision?</div>
<p>We also need to take a closer look at what Johnson has been saying since the Supreme Court decision.</p>
<p>After all, Barnes claimed Johnson ""recently"" came out in support of a ban, which is hard to reconcile with the idea of a measure he has sponsored for a decade.</p>
<p>To that end, both sides pointed us to the same link: <a href=""https://www.gmtoday.com/daily_news/news/johnson-michels-campaign-in-germantown/article_2bf0f864-1e24-11ed-9367-fb8523ffb632.html"">an Aug. 17 interview with Johnson published by the Washington County Daily News</a>.</p>
<p>In it, Johnson says he doesn’t think that Supreme Court justices or Congress should decide on when abortion is allowed, rather it should be up to the states:</p>
<p>""I look forward to every state, the people in every state, hopefully having a serious, compassionate and sympathetic discussion to decide this question, and this is what needs to be decided. At what point does society have the responsibility to protect life? That’s the question on the table. I don’t think nine justices should decide it. I don’t think 535 members of Congress should decide it. I think it should be decided by the people, state by state, maybe sometime in the future.""</p>
<p>He even goes on to suggest a referendum — or even multiple referendums — may be needed to fully sort through the issue in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>""Whatever is the most direct way of having the people make that decision, OK,"" he said. ""And, this may take multiple elections. It might take a different referendum to hone in on where does Wisconsin, where do the people, believe society has the responsibility to protect life. Again, I’ve got my own views, other people have their own. Let’s find out where, where is that center.""</p>
<p>But the Barnes campaign points to a separate line from the same interview in which Johnson says the federal government may have a role after all:</p>
<p>""You know, maybe Congress can take a look at what the states have done and say, ‘We probably ought to place this limit here,’ based on new information or whatever.""</p>
<p>So, Johnson is saying the states should decide, but the federal government might still need to step in and draw the lines differently.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, all of that is consistent with what Johnson has said in <a href=""https://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/sen-ron-johnson-believes-states-should-decide-on-abortion-laws"">other venues since the ruling</a>, and <a href=""https://wisfacts.com/for-the-record-my-position-on-abortion/"">on his website</a>. </p>
<p>It is also in line with what he said in May 2019, <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/18/sen-ron-johnson-opposes-alabama-law-but-regrets-roe-ruling/3721547002/"">in an interview at the state Republican party convention</a>, in which he said he opposed an Alabama law that banned abortion after six weeks — a period before which women may not even know they are pregnant. (That, opponents said, effectively banned all abortions.)</p>
<p>In that interview, Johnson said he wished the Supreme Court had not legalized abortion in 1973 in the Roe case, noting: ""Had that played out state by state, my guess, we would have pretty much a uniform standard, and we’d protect life in the womb of a mother far earlier than we do now.""</p>
<p>So, whether someone agrees with Johnson’s position or not, Barnes also overplays his hand by suggesting that Johnson is somehow going further than he had before, in the wake of the new ruling.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling </div>
<p>Barnes claimed that Johnson ""just came out in favor of a federal abortion ban."" </p>
<p>Johnson has said he supports a federal ban after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but that’s not what Barnes said or how he framed it. In the rhetoric he used, Barnes made it sound as if it could be an outright ban — no abortion ever.</p>
<p>What’s more, Barnes also made it appear as if Johnson changed positions in reaction to the Supreme Court ruling. He did not. Since the decision, Johnson has emphasized that states should decide — though he has left open the door to the federal government stepping in at some point, if necessary.</p>
<p>Our definition for Mostly False is: ""The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""</p>
<p>That fits here.</p>

</div>]","The U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin, featuring incumbent Republican Ron Johnson and Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes, is full of sharp contrasts.
And sharp claims.
Consider this Aug. 17 tweet from Barnes, in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court decision throwing out Roe v. Wade: 
""Ron Johnson just came out in favor of a federal abotion ban. We knew this was coming … he is doing everything he can to drag us back in time and strip women of their rights and freedoms."" 
For this check, we’ll focus on the first portion of the tweet: Does Johnson, who is seeking a third term, back a federal abortion ban? And did he announce such a position recently?
We’ll start with a truism of politics: The closer you get to an election, particularly a hotly contested one, the stronger statements are framed — and often the more facts get lost in the matter.
In this case, there should be little surprise that the two sides differ on what the word ""ban"" means. 
But there’s little question that Johnson’s position has not suddenly changed dramatically.
Let’s dig in.
A look at Johnson’s record on the issue
The Supreme Court decision, of course, undid the constitutional right to an abortion granted under the Roe v. Wade ruling, sending the matter to the states. 
Abortion-rights supports say one way to address the situation now is to pass a measure permitting abortions — in effect, making the standards under Roe part of federal law. Abortion foes, meanwhile, have long worked to pass federal laws limiting abortion.
When we asked Barnes’ campaign to back up the claim, a spokesperson pointed to several things, including those GOP-led efforts and Johnson’s support for them.
First, they cited a 2019 bill that called for prison time for performing or attempting an abortion after a fetus reaches 20 weeks or more, except in cases in which pregnancy endangers the mother’s life or results from rape or incest.
Johnson was a co-sponsor of the bill, according to Congress.gov and voted in favor of it on Feb. 25, 2020, according to Senate records. According to Congressional records, Johnson also supported similar bills in 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2021.
This is where the definition of a ban comes in.
The Johnson side says ""a ban is a ban is a ban."" That’s a quote from Ben Voelkel, with the Johnson campaign. In other words, unless abortion is prohibited entirely, with no exceptions, it is not a ban. 
Meanwhile, the Barnes side would argue that, yes, a ban is a ban. That is, any sort of ban — even one that starts at 20 weeks of pregnancy — is still ""a ban."" 
They note Johnson himself used the word ""ban"" in describing his support for the matter in a May 2022 segment on Newsmax: ""I signed on to a national bill that would have banned abortions after 20 weeks."" (That four-second clip is even featured on the YouTube page for the Barnes campaign)
But consider the remainder of the Barnes tweet for context. He says of Johnson, ""He is doing everything he can to drag us back in time and strip women of their rights and freedoms.""

New Washington state law allows “government to take away minors from parents if they refuse to agree to gender-transition surgery.”












By Tom Kertscher • May 17, 2023







The phrasing leaves the impression that Johnson would ban abortion entirely, or at least lets readers reach that conclusion. 
The bottom line: Barnes does not fully make his case on this point.
What has happened since the Supreme Court decision?
We also need to take a closer look at what Johnson has been saying since the Supreme Court decision.
After all, Barnes claimed Johnson ""recently"" came out in support of a ban, which is hard to reconcile with the idea of a measure he has sponsored for a decade.
To that end, both sides pointed us to the same link: an Aug. 17 interview with Johnson published by the Washington County Daily News.
In it, Johnson says he doesn’t think that Supreme Court justices or Congress should decide on when abortion is allowed, rather it should be up to the states:
""I look forward to every state, the people in every state, hopefully having a serious, compassionate and sympathetic discussion to decide this question, and this is what needs to be decided. At what point does society have the responsibility to protect life? That’s the question on the table. I don’t think nine justices should decide it. I don’t think 535 members of Congress should decide it. I think it should be decided by the people, state by state, maybe sometime in the future.""
He even goes on to suggest a referendum — or even multiple referendums — may be needed to fully sort through the issue in Wisconsin.
""Whatever is the most direct way of having the people make that decision, OK,"" he said. ""And, this may take multiple elections. It might take a different referendum to hone in on where does Wisconsin, where do the people, believe society has the responsibility to protect life. Again, I’ve got my own views, other people have their own. Let’s find out where, where is that center.""
But the Barnes campaign points to a separate line from the same interview in which Johnson says the federal government may have a role after all:
""You know, maybe Congress can take a look at what the states have done and say, ‘We probably ought to place this limit here,’ based on new information or whatever.""
So, Johnson is saying the states should decide, but the federal government might still need to step in and draw the lines differently.
Generally speaking, all of that is consistent with what Johnson has said in other venues since the ruling, and on his website. 
It is also in line with what he said in May 2019, in an interview at the state Republican party convention, in which he said he opposed an Alabama law that banned abortion after six weeks — a period before which women may not even know they are pregnant. (That, opponents said, effectively banned all abortions.)

So, whether someone agrees with Johnson’s position or not, Barnes also overplays his hand by suggesting that Johnson is somehow going further than he had before, in the wake of the new ruling.
",PolitiFact," 
Barnes claimed that Johnson ""just came out in favor of a federal abortion ban."" 
Johnson has said he supports a federal ban after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but that’s not what Barnes said or how he framed it. In the rhetoric he used, Barnes made it sound as if it could be an outright ban — no abortion ever.
What’s more, Barnes also made it appear as if Johnson changed positions in reaction to the Supreme Court ruling. He did not. Since the decision, Johnson has emphasized that states should decide — though he has left open the door to the federal government stepping in at some point, if necessary.

That fits here.

<p>On saying Walker cut $1.6 billion, Mitchell’s campaign cited <a href=""https://forwardinstitute.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/wisconsin-budget-policy-and-poverty-in-education-2013.pdf"">a 2013 report </a>by the Forward Institute, a Madison-based think tank that operated for several years. The report doesn’t state, though, that Walker made a $1.6 billion cut in education funding. Rather, it says he reduced by that amount the maximum that school districts could increase their property tax levies.</p>
<p>The report’s author, <a href=""http://www.frame4future.com/contact"">Scott Wittkopf</a>, who is advising the campaign of another Democrat for governor, <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/personalities/mike-mccabe/"">Mike McCabe</a>, told us Mitchell has a point but his statement reflects a common misunderstanding of the complexities of school funding.</p>
<p>To flesh this out, here’s what we found in a 2011 fact check on a similar claim  — that Walker’s 2011-’13 budget ""cuts overall funding for public schools by $1.6 billion.""

<ul style=""list-style-type:disc"">
<li>
<p>That 2009-’11 budget, approved by a Democratic governor and Democratic-run Legislature, also directed the next Legislature to reset the property tax limit in the 2011-’13 budget (Walker’s first) to what it was before it was reduced.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul style=""list-style-type:disc"">
<li>
<p>But Walker and the Legislature, which had turned Republican, did not abide by that directive. Instead, the 2011-’13 budget imposed a lower limit on how much school districts could increase their property taxes than what the 2009-’11 budget called for.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In sum, some Democrats argue that by not abiding by the 2009-’11 budget directive, school districts were prevented from levying $1.6 billion more in property taxes.</p>
<p>But that figure assumes that all school districts levy the maximum allowed in property taxes, which never occurs. And that calculation doesn’t take into account some school districts’ ability, under Walker’s Act 10 collective bargaining legislation, to save money by requiring employees to pay more for their health and pension benefits.</p>
<p>Bottom line: The $1.6 billion refers to a limit on school districts’ ability to increase how much they collect in property tax revenue, but it is not an actual funding cut.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/apr/20/tony-evers/did-scott-walker-take-1-billion-wisconsin-schools-/"">As we found</a> in April 2018, in a fact checking a claim by another of the Democratic candidates, <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/personalities/tony-evers/"">Tony Evers</a>, the actual reduction in state funding of schools over the two-year period of Walker’s 2011-’13 state was $784 million.</p>
<p><strong>‘Put back’ $630 million -- no, more than that</strong></p>
<p>The other part of Mitchell’s claim is meant to convey that, even though Walker touts recent increases he’s made in school funding, those increases don’t come close to making up what was cut.</p>
<p>But Mitchell gets into trouble because, while the first part of his claim refers to the ability of school districts to raise taxes, the second part of his claim refers to actual cash that the state gives to school districts.</p>
<p>Moreover, in saying that only $630 million has been put back, Mitchell’s campaign <a href=""https://madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/election-matters/wisconsin-budget-committee-approves-million-boost-for-k--schools/article_e80cab6a-aa78-551b-ac52-ecfe188d1061.html"">cites</a> only Walker’s 2017-’19 state budget, which increases state funding to schools <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2017/09/21/gov-scott-walker-sign-76-b-wisconsin-budget-money-schools-fees-hybrids/688388001/"">by $639 million</a>. It provides for an additional $200 per student in the first year and additional $204 in the second year, as Walker now touts in his re-election campaign.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the first time Walker has increased state funding to schools. In fact, in each budget since the 2011 budget that reduced school funding, he has increased state funds to schools. The total restored is about $1 billion.</p>
<p>That being said, as we found in the Evers fact check, during Walker’s tenure school districts have collected about <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/apr/20/tony-evers/did-scott-walker-take-1-billion-wisconsin-schools-/"">$183.6 million less</a> in state money than they would have had funding levels remained where they were when Walker took office.</p>
<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>
<p>Mitchell says Walker ""has cut more from public education than he's put back in, obviously. He took $1.6 billion and some change away and then puts back $630 million and he's calling that progress.""</p>
<p>Walker’s first state budget in 2011 did reduce by $1.6 billion the maximum amount that school districts had expected they would be allowed to increase their property tax levies. So, that was not a cut, but it did curtail how much additional money school districts could raise on their own.</p>
<p>On actual state funding of schools, Walker did cut about $784 million with his first state budget. But he has been adding back funding with each of his subsequent budgets, to the tune of about $1 billion in total.</p>
<p><br/>
Mitchell’s statement contains an element of truth, but mixes apples and oranges and ignores facts that would give a different impression. Our rating is Mostly False.</p>

</div>]","After Republican Scott Walker dubbed himself the ""education governor,"" many Democrats, figuratively speaking, started baying for blood.
To them, Walker slashed and burned school funding in 2011 with his first state budget. They are galled by the notion of ""education governor,"" even if Walker has since been adding back funding.
So, let’s sort out the Republican governor’s record on school funding.
We’ll use a claim by state firefighters union president Mahlon Mitchell, one of the eight Democrats hoping to win the Aug. 14, 2018, primary to run against Walker.




All our fact checks in the governor’s race.




 
The claim
Mitchell made his claim June 19, 2018, on the ""Devil’s Advocates,"" a Milwaukee-based liberal radio talk show. He declared that Walker ""has cut more from public education than he's put back in, obviously. He took $1.6 billion and some change away and then puts back $630 million, and he's calling that progress.""
 
It’s a claim Mitchell has made repeatedly, in one form or another, and one we’re likely to hear again before the primary and the Nov. 6, 2018, general election.
Based on previous fact checks we’ve done, there is an element of truth in Mitchell’s claim. But he gets into trouble, partly by mixing apples and oranges in the two figures he uses.

On saying Walker cut $1.6 billion, Mitchell’s campaign cited a 2013 report by the Forward Institute, a Madison-based think tank that operated for several years.

The report’s author, Scott Wittkopf, who is advising the campaign of another Democrat for governor, Mike McCabe, told us Mitchell has a point but his statement reflects a common misunderstanding of the complexities of school funding.
To flesh this out, here’s what we found in a 2011 fact check on a similar claim  — that Walker’s 2011-’13 budget ""cuts overall funding for public schools by $1.6 billion."" We rated it Mostly False.

<html><body><p>Even with President Donald Trump hospitalized after contracting the coronavirus, Trump’s top allies continue to paint a picture of Trump hard at work for the American people while Democratic rival Joe Biden dawdles in his basement.</p>
<p>On Saturday Oct. 3, Trump’s daughter Ivanka <a href=""https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/1312590918915108866"">shared a picture</a> of Trump working a conference table at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center with the caption, ""Nothing can stop him from working for the American people. RELENTLESS!"" (The photos don’t show what Trump was signing.)</p>
<p>On Sunday, top Trump adviser Jason Miller said Trump was doing well and that the president and his campaign have taken COVID-19 seriously. But, Miller also noted, the president needed to continue advocating for and working on behalf of the American people.</p>
<p>Contrast that with Biden, Miller told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. ""We’ve seen with Joe Biden, I mean, we can’t all stay in our basement for the rest of our lives,"" Miller said.</p>
<p>It’s one of Trump’s favorite attacks against Biden. It’s also, by any objective measure, wrong.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">What Trump says about Biden’s basement, a sampling</div>
<p>Before his coronavirus diagnosis, Trump made the basement attack a routine part of his campaign speech.</p>
<p>""I got a guy who stays in his damn basement all day long and I'm doing this,""  Trump said at a Virginia rally Sept. 25.</p>
<p>""Where's Hunter? You know where he is? Yeah. He's in the basement with his father,"" Trump said, talking about Biden’s son Hunter on Sept. 21 in Ohio.</p>
<p>""I've been in so many states the last few days. Yeah. Well you need a lot of energy to do this job properly. You can't be sitting in your basement for four days and come out,"" Trump said Sept. 14 in Arizona.</p>
<p>""He's in his basement right now, and he's saying, ‘What do I do?’ He calls his handlers, ‘What do I do about this?’ He hasn't left in two and a half days,"" said Trump Sept. 13 in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>""He's in his damn basement again. No, he's in his basement. He's in his basement,"" Trump said Sept. 12 in Nevada.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">These don’t look like basements</div>
<p>In the first months of the pandemic, when many states employed significant restrictions, <a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/24/dems-warm-to-bidens-bunker-strategy-338853"">Biden ran much of his campaign</a> from his Delaware home.

</div>]","Even with President Donald Trump hospitalized after contracting the coronavirus, Trump’s top allies continue to paint a picture of Trump hard at work for the American people while Democratic rival Joe Biden dawdles in his basement.
On Saturday Oct. 3, Trump’s daughter Ivanka shared a picture of Trump working a conference table at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center with the caption, ""Nothing can stop him from working for the American people. RELENTLESS!"" (The photos don’t show what Trump was signing.)
On Sunday, top Trump adviser Jason Miller said Trump was doing well and that the president and his campaign have taken COVID-19 seriously. But, Miller also noted, the president needed to continue advocating for and working on behalf of the American people.
Contrast that with Biden, Miller told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. ""We’ve seen with Joe Biden, I mean, we can’t all stay in our basement for the rest of our lives,"" Miller said.
It’s one of Trump’s favorite attacks against Biden. It’s also, by any objective measure, wrong.
What Trump says about Biden’s basement, a sampling
Before his coronavirus diagnosis, Trump made the basement attack a routine part of his campaign speech.
""I got a guy who stays in his damn basement all day long and I'm doing this,""  Trump said at a Virginia rally Sept. 25.
""Where's Hunter? You know where he is? Yeah. He's in the basement with his father,"" Trump said, talking about Biden’s son Hunter on Sept. 21 in Ohio.
""I've been in so many states the last few days. Yeah. Well you need a lot of energy to do this job properly. You can't be sitting in your basement for four days and come out,"" Trump said Sept. 14 in Arizona.
""He's in his basement right now, and he's saying, ‘What do I do?’ He calls his handlers, ‘What do I do about this?’ He hasn't left in two and a half days,"" said Trump Sept. 13 in Las Vegas.
""He's in his damn basement again. No, he's in his basement. He's in his basement,"" Trump said Sept. 12 in Nevada.
These don’t look like basements
In the first months of the pandemic, when many states employed significant restrictions, Biden ran much of his campaign from his Delaware home. He built a TV set in his basement to interact with voters virtually. Not all those interactions went smoothly. 
Trump also suspended in-person campaigning from March 2 through June 20, when he held an indoor rally in Tulsa, Okla.
But the claim that Biden stays in his basement is easily refuted.
Let’s look at Biden’s events in September as an example. (All links go to the C-SPAN video so you can watch the event for yourself.)
Sept. 2: Biden delivered remarks in Wilmington, Del., on reopening schools.
Sept. 3: Biden and his wife visited Kenosha, Wis., where Jacob Blake, an unarmed Black man, was shot by police. Biden spoke from a church about the history of systemic racism in the United States.

<p>President Donald Trump returned to one of his favorite punching bags March 29: Amazon.</p>
<p>""I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election,"" Trump <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/979326715272065024"">tweeted</a>. ""Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state &amp; local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!""</p>
<div class=""artembed""></div>
<p>We once rated Trump’s claim that Amazon is a ""no-tax monopoly"" <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/26/donald-trump/amazon-no-tax-monopoly-donald-trump-said/"">Pants on Fire</a>. We decided it was time to <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/aug/16/trump-takes-aim-amazon-barbed-tweet/"">revisit</a> Trump’s takedown of the online giant for accuracy.</p>
<p>Trump made three key claims, so we took a look at each one individually. We found his points lacked important context.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">""Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state &amp; local governments""</div>
<p>This used to be accurate but is not exactly the case anymore. Amazon pays taxes in most states.</p>
<p>Amazon pays the federal corporate tax and collects taxes in all 46 states where sales taxes exist, plus the District of Columbia. (This excludes Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon.)</p>
<p>Amazon paid $957 million in income tax in 2017, according to regulatory filings. Amazon paid <a href=""https://itep.org/amazon-inc-paid-zero-in-federal-taxes-in-2017-gets-789-million-windfall-from-new-tax-law/"">nothing</a> in federal taxes this year thanks to tax credits and, in large part, Trump’s new tax law.</p>
<p>But the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy <a href=""https://itep.org/many-localities-are-unprepared-to-collect-taxes-on-online-purchases-amazon-com-and-other-e-retailers-receive-tax-advantage-over-local-businesses/"">found</a> that Amazon is either not collecting local taxes or is charging a lower tax rate than local retailers in Alabama, Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The digital retailer’s decision to collect state sales tax is mostly voluntary, as a 1992 Supreme Court ruling effectively gave a free pass on state taxes to companies with no brick-and-mortar property or employees in the state.</p>
<p>Max Behlke, the director of budget and tax at the National Conference of State Legislatures, told PolitiFact in <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/aug/16/trump-takes-aim-amazon-barbed-tweet/"">August</a> it was unfair to single out Amazon, given the many other online retailers that follow the same practice.</p>
<p>Amazon has pushed to have Congress require all online retailers abide by the same state sales tax.</p>
<p>However, Amazon does not collect state taxes on third-party sellers who use the Amazon platform to sell their products. Some <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-16/trump-says-amazon-does-great-damage-to-retailers-shares-fall"">estimates</a> suggest half of Amazon’s total sales go through third parties.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Amazon uses ""our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.)""</div>
<p>Much of the Postal Service’s decline is attributable to the dwindling use of paper, first-class mail, and <a href=""https://ir.citi.com/XInLvxkr5F%2FJvyPr1NMl%2FPcIgrn%2BXqplW8cqbv2ImZxLKrWAiRT%2BcFMjQe6C%2BuQT9n1mvCnznGU%3D"">billions</a> of dollars in operating costs. But growth in their shipping and packages market, which <a href=""http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/financials/financial-conditions-results-reports/fy2017-q1.pdf"">includes</a> Amazon, ""provided some help to the financial picture of the Postal Service,"" according to a <a href=""http://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2017/pr17_069.htm"">2017 USPS press release</a>.</p>
<p>However, Amazon does get a special rate, which is kept under wraps, as the USPS provides discounts to companies for which the postal service does last mile delivery. (Last mile delivery is where the company does bulk delivery and package sorting before a package is delivered to your door by USPS.) A special arrangement is what landed the USPS <a href=""https://www.geekwire.com/2014/amazon-getting-packages-sunday-via-u-s-postal-service/"">Sunday delivery</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon uses the United States Postal Service to deliver about <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/postal-service-may-get-freedom-raise-stamp-prices"">40 percent</a> of its packages, according to PBS Newshour.</p>
<p>But it’s unlikely the deal is hurting USPS either, as the independent Postal Regulatory Commission <a href=""https://www.prc.gov/docs/104/104398/2017_ACD.pdf"">reviews</a> all deals and the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act made it illegal for USPS to price parcel delivery below its cost.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Amazon is ""putting many thousands of retailers out of business!""</div>
<p>Last year was not a great year for retail. While consumption habits, the over-supply of malls and megastores like Walmart played a <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/04/retail-meltdown-of-2017/522384/"">role</a>, so did e-commerce.</p>
<p>""There’s no doubt that e-commerce is causing brick and mortar stores to close their doors,"" Behlke said. ""Amazon is not the only one, but they are by far the largest share of online sales.""</p>
<p>The retail sectors with greater job losses are those that compete more directly with online commerce</p>
<p>In July 2016, electronics and appliance stores employed 527,500 workers, according to the <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/tab4.txt"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. By July 2017, employment shrunk by almost 4 percent, or nearly 21,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Retailers in sporting goods, books and music — also considered direct competitors of online sellers — have also seen steep job losses over that same period.</p>
<p>At the same time, businesses that don't compete as directly with online commerce — sellers of motor vehicles, gas stations and building materials, for instance — have seen some of the strongest growth, Jed Kolko, the chief economist at the jobs site Indeed.com, <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/aug/16/trump-takes-aim-amazon-barbed-tweet/"">told us</a> in August.</p>

<p>The pledge <a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/383199261.html"">made news</a> back home.</p>
<p>But a claim Clarke made about doctors killing people is what caught our attention.</p>
<p>The conservative firebrand, who has built a national profile with <a href=""http://insider.foxnews.com/tag/david-clarke"">frequent appearances</a> on the Fox News Channel, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Iep-M236iA"">spoke</a> June 13, 2016 in Albany to the <a href=""http://www.newyorkoathkeepers.com/"">New York Oath Keepers</a>.</p>
<p>The group, sometimes dubbed a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/opinion/sunday/the-ideological-roots-of-the-oregon-standoff.html"">citizens</a> <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/12/01/the-oath-keepers-the-militant-militia-now-roaming-the-streets-of-ferguson/"">militia</a>, says its aim is to educate people ""on the true purpose of the Constitution, which is to preserve liberty for the people."" It gave Clarke its annual leadership <a href=""https://www.oathkeepers.org/new-york-oath-keepers-announce-the-recipients-of-their-constitutional-awards-for-2016/"">award</a>.</p>
<p>The 38-year law enforcement veteran spent much of his speech defending police agencies from criticism by outsiders. </p>
<p>""I decided at one point that I'd had enough. I was not going to let somebody who had never done this job for one day in their life transform this profession,"" Clarke said.</p>
<p>""That would be akin to me trying to transform the medical community after a botched surgery when I know nothing about the medical community. I'm not educated in it, I'm not trained in it. By the way, did you know that doctors kill about 250,000 people a year in botched surgeries?</p>
<p>""Has anybody-- has President Obama or the attorney general or Black Lives Matter -- demanded that the medical community be transformed? No. The medical community will have to figure that out.""</p>
<p>There was a 250,000 figure in the news recently. But Clarke misstates it.</p>
<p><strong>Recent study</strong></p>
<p>Clarke refused to provide us information to back up his claim, saying through a spokeswoman that he ""gets his data from the same sources that the anti-gun bigots get their data from.""</p>
<p>But it seems likely his statement was based on news reports about <a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2139"">a study</a> on medical errors that was published several weeks earlier in <em><a href=""http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj"">The BMJ</a></em>, formerly known as the British Medical Journal. It is an international peer-reviewed medical journal.</p>
<p>The study, which was done by researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/04/medical-errors-are-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-united-states-study.html"">made</a> <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/05/03/476636183/death-certificates-undercount-toll-of-medical-errors"">news</a> in the <a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/378117621.html"">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a> and in news outlets <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/05/03/researchers-medical-errors-now-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-united-states/"">across</a> the nation.</p>

<p>In publishing the study,<em> The BMJ</em> declared that medical errors are the third-leading cause of death in the United States, behind heart disease and cancer.</p>
<p>Those diseases, <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm"">according to</a> the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each cause about 600,000 deaths per year.</p>
<p>Regarding Clarke's claim, there are two important things to note: </p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The study did not attempt to do a count of deaths attributed to medical errors -- rather it made <a href=""http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/study_suggests_medical_errors_now_third_leading_cause_of_death_in_the_us"">estimates</a> based on medical death rate data and hospitalizations.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> More importantly, the 250,000 estimate was based on many types of medical errors, not just botched surgeries -- <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/05/03/researchers-medical-errors-now-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-united-states/"">anything from</a> bad doctors to communication breakdowns when patients are handed off from one department to another, to medicine dosage mistakes, diagnostic errors and more.</p>
<p>""It boils down to people dying from the care that they receive rather than the disease for which they are seeking care,"" Johns Hopkins professor of surgery <a href=""http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/1565/martin-a-makary"">Martin Makary</a>, the study’s lead author, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/05/03/researchers-medical-errors-now-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-united-states/"">told</a> the <em>Washington Post</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Digging deeper</strong></p>
<p>Critics pointed out that the study did not take into account studies from 2008 and later, when improvements have been made, <em>Modern Healthcare</em> <a href=""http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160504/NEWS/160509962"">reported</a>.</p>
<p>For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in December 2015 that from 2010 to 2014, hospital patients experienced 2.1 million fewer hospital-acquired conditions, resulting in about <a href=""https://www.ahrq.gov/news/newsroom/press-releases/2015/saving-lives.html"">87,000 fewer patients dying in hospitals</a>.</p>
<p>On other hand, we found that some studies have published estimates that were higher than the one from Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p><a href=""http://journals.lww.com/journalpatientsafety/Fulltext/2013/09000/A_New,_Evidence_based_Estimate_of_Patient_Harms.2.aspx"">A study</a> published in 2013 in the <em>Journal of Patient Safety</em> estimated that more than 400,000 patients per year die in hospitals as a result of ""preventable harm."" And a <a href=""http://www.dailynews.com/health/20140425/325000-deaths-in-american-hospitals-due-to-medical-errors-sen-barbara-boxer-says"">2014 report</a> for the U.S. Senate estimated medical errors killed 325,000 people per year.</p>
<p>Like the Johns Hopkins study, neither of those studies made an estimate of the number of deaths due specifically to errors in surgery. And Makary, the lead author of the Johns Hopkins study, told us he is not aware of any studies that count surgery deaths.</p>
<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>
<p>Clarke said: ""Doctors kill about 250,000 people a year in botched surgeries.""</p>
<p>A study released several weeks before Clarke made the statement estimates that 251,000 people per year in the United States die from any number of types of medical errors.</p>
<p>But that figure is an estimate. Moreover, no estimate was made in the study on the number of deaths due to botched surgeries.</p>
<p>We rate Clarke’s statement False.</p> <a href=""https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/720b6f29-2935-4a40-adbd-b43c972c33dc"">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/720b6f29-2935-4a40-adbd-b43c972c33dc</a>

</div>]","Speaking to an anti-government group in New York, Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. vowed to ""do everything that I can"" to get Donald Trump elected president.
The pledge made news back home.
But a claim Clarke made about doctors killing people is what caught our attention.
The conservative firebrand, who has built a national profile with frequent appearances on the Fox News Channel, spoke June 13, 2016 in Albany to the New York Oath Keepers.
The group, sometimes dubbed a citizens militia, says its aim is to educate people ""on the true purpose of the Constitution, which is to preserve liberty for the people."" It gave Clarke its annual leadership award.
The 38-year law enforcement veteran spent much of his speech defending police agencies from criticism by outsiders. 
""I decided at one point that I'd had enough. I was not going to let somebody who had never done this job for one day in their life transform this profession,"" Clarke said.
""That would be akin to me trying to transform the medical community after a botched surgery when I know nothing about the medical community. I'm not educated in it, I'm not trained in it. By the way, did you know that doctors kill about 250,000 people a year in botched surgeries?
""Has anybody-- has President Obama or the attorney general or Black Lives Matter -- demanded that the medical community be transformed? No. The medical community will have to figure that out.""
There was a 250,000 figure in the news recently. But Clarke misstates it.
Recent study
Clarke refused to provide us information to back up his claim, saying through a spokeswoman that he ""gets his data from the same sources that the anti-gun bigots get their data from.""
But it seems likely his statement was based on news reports about a study on medical errors that was published several weeks earlier in The BMJ, formerly known as the British Medical Journal. It is an international peer-reviewed medical journal.
The study, which was done by researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, made news in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and in news outlets across the nation.
Its major finding: An estimated 251,454 deaths per year, or 9.5 percent of all deaths in the United States, stem from a medical error.",PolitiFact,"
In publishing the study, The BMJ declared that medical errors are the third-leading cause of death in the United States, behind heart disease and cancer.
Those diseases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each cause about 600,000 deaths per year.
Regarding Clarke's claim, there are two important things to note: 
1. The study did not attempt to do a count of deaths attributed to medical errors -- rather it made estimates based on medical death rate data and hospitalizations.
2. More importantly, the 250,000 estimate was based on many types of medical errors, not just botched surgeries -- anything from bad doctors to communication breakdowns when patients are handed off from one department to another, to medicine dosage mistakes, diagnostic errors and more.
""It boils down to people dying from the care that they receive rather than the disease for which they are seeking care,"" Johns Hopkins professor of surgery Martin Makary, the study’s lead author, told the Washington Post.
Digging deeper
Critics pointed out that the study did not take into account studies from 2008 and later, when improvements have been made, Modern Healthcare reported.
For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in December 2015 that from 2010 to 2014, hospital patients experienced 2.1 million fewer hospital-acquired conditions, resulting in about 87,000 fewer patients dying in hospitals.
On other hand, we found that some studies have published estimates that were higher than the one from Johns Hopkins.
A study published in 2013 in the Journal of Patient Safety estimated that more than 400,000 patients per year die in hospitals as a result of ""preventable harm."" And a 2014 report for the U.S. Senate estimated medical errors killed 325,000 people per year.
Like the Johns Hopkins study, neither of those studies made an estimate of the number of deaths due specifically to errors in surgery. And Makary, the lead author of the Johns Hopkins study, told us he is not aware of any studies that count surgery deaths.
Our rating
Clarke said: ""Doctors kill about 250,000 people a year in botched surgeries.""
A study released several weeks before Clarke made the statement estimates that 251,000 people per year in the United States die from any number of types of medical errors.
But that figure is an estimate. Moreover, no estimate was made in the study on the number of deaths due to botched surgeries.
We rate Clarke’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/720b6f29-2935-4a40-adbd-b43c972c33dc

<div class=""pf_subheadline"">The claim</div>
<p>The post includes a chart that purports to show the ""relative fatality rate"" rising as second doses of the two-dose Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are given.</p>
<p>The user’s source for the claim is an <a href=""https://kamal-mokeddem.medium.com/spike-protein-a-dose-dependent-killer-2e26ec28de3f"">article</a> on Medium that includes a slightly different version of the chart. </p>

<p>A minuscule percentage of vaccinated people have died from COVID-19.</p>
<p>As of Sept. 27, 2021, more than 183 million people in the United States had been fully vaccinated and there were 5,226 breakthrough infections in which the person died, <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html"">according</a> to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That comes out to 0.0028%. Of those, 86% were people over age 65. And 17% were people who didn’t have COVID-19 symptoms or whose death was not COVID-related. (For example, someone who was hospitalized for injuries following an auto accident and tested positive for COVID upon hospital admission.)</p>
<p>The CDC <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/science-health-coronavirus-pandemic-rochelle-walensky-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-31ddcca6119e018bd826d2a05df7f68b"">reported</a> on Sept. 10 that, based on a study of more than 600,000 COVID-19 cases in 13 states from April through mid-July, unvaccinated people were 11 times more likely to die than vaccinated people.</p>

</div>]","As variants of the coronavirus continue to take more lives in the United States — by and large, among the unvaccinated — an Instagram post blames the increased deaths on COVID-19 vaccines.
""New data shows that death is proportional to dose,"" the post states. 
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Research shows the unvaccinated are far more likely to die from COVID-19, and that there is no clear evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused any deaths in the U.S.
The claim
The post includes a chart that purports to show the ""relative fatality rate"" rising as second doses of the two-dose Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are given.
The user’s source for the claim is an article on Medium that includes a slightly different version of the chart. 
The author of that article indicates his expertise is in ""cryptocurrency, quantitative trading and trading technology."" He says in the article that the chart is based on his analysis of data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.
That analysis is flawed, in that VAERS data cannot be used to conclude that a vaccine caused a death.
Unvaccinated 11 times more likely to die
COVID-19 has killed more than 700,000 people in the U.S. The vaccines authorized in the U.S. — Moderna and Pfizer, along with the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson — have been shown to significantly reduce the likelihood of severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19.

“A European study has found COVID vaccines could be causing ‘long-term brain damage.’”












By Tom Kertscher • May 18, 2023







A minuscule percentage of vaccinated people have died from COVID-19.
As of Sept. 27, 2021, more than 183 million people in the United States had been fully vaccinated and there were 5,226 breakthrough infections in which the person died, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That comes out to 0.0028%. Of those, 86% were people over age 65. And 17% were people who didn’t have COVID-19 symptoms or whose death was not COVID-related. (For example, someone who was hospitalized for injuries following an auto accident and tested positive for COVID upon hospital admission.)
The CDC reported on Sept. 10 that, based on a study of more than 600,000 COVID-19 cases in 13 states from April through mid-July, unvaccinated people were 11 times more likely to die than vaccinated people.
No evidence vaccines have caused death
There is no clear evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused any deaths in the U.S. Researchers are still evaluating whether there is a connection between the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine and rare types of blood clots that have led to deaths, but such cases are few.

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>All eyes are on North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, where candidates are trading accusations about health care in the final days before a Sept. 10 special election.</p>
<p>At a WBTV debate Aug. 28, Democrat Dan McCready accused Republican state Sen. Dan Bishop of voting against a bill that would allow pharmacists to inform people about cheaper alternative drugs.</p>
<p>""He took the only vote from either party — the only vote — against pharmacists being able to tell people about lower-cost drugs,"" McCready said.</p>
<p>It’s a claim McCready has repeated throughout the race on <a href=""https://twitter.com/McCreadyForNC/status/1149071453620461568"">social media</a> and in an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRHAfZJu56A"">attack ad</a>.</p>
<p>He’s talking about <a href=""https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2017/h466"">The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act</a>, which banned gag orders discouraging pharmacists from offering customers cheaper alternative drugs. It passed 115-0 in the House and 45-1 in the Senate in 2017. </p>
<p>And in fact, Bishop was the <a href=""https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2017/S/451"">only member</a> of the North Carolina General Assembly to vote against the bill before Gov. Roy Cooper signed it into law.</p>
<p>On the debate stage, Bishop said his opposition was ""for procedural reasons."" When he’s been confronted with the charge before, the state senator has said he didn’t have time to read the final version of the House bill before the vote and noted that he supported a similar Senate bill.</p>
<p>We asked both campaigns about Bishop’s position on the policy. While it’s true that Bishop cast the lone vote against The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act, his votes and statements indicate he’s in favor of allowing pharmacists to tell people about cheaper alternative drugs as long as that doesn’t burden pharmacies — and, in turn, customers — with higher costs.</p>
<p><strong>Bishop supports banning pharmacy gag orders</strong></p>
<p>The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act was introduced in both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly in March 2017.</p>
<p>Over the next several weeks, those identical bills made their way through various committees in the House and Senate that amended their language. In the Senate version, Bishop backed changes that his campaign says were designed to protect consumers from additional costs. </p>
<p>On April 26, the bill that Bishop helped revise <a href=""https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2017/S/152"">unanimously passed</a> in the state Senate.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>When a House version of the bill was added to the calendar on June 28, Bishop says he didn’t have time to read the bill to check that it included similar amendments.</p>
<p>""That was a big sticking point for him,"" said Jessica Proud, a spokesperson for Bishop’s campaign. ""He didn’t feel comfortable voting for legislation without ensuring that those changes had been made."" (If he had, he would have found the bill was indeed identical.)</p>
<p><strong>Didn’t have time</strong></p>
<p>How should elected officials vote when they haven’t done their homework?</p>
<p>Bishop says he votes no on any legislation he hasn’t fully read. In an <a href=""https://www.wbtv.com/2019/06/20/mccready-announces-plan-lower-rx-prices-bashes-bishop-healthcare-record/"">email to the Charlotte television station WBTV</a>, Bishop responded to McCready’s claim: ""This companion House version was added to the Senate calendar on June 28 at the last minute and, unlike Nancy Pelosi’s advice on Obamacare, I don’t vote for bills without an opportunity to read them.""</p>
<p>But McCready has questioned why Bishop didn’t have time to read a bill less than two pages long.</p>
<p>""State Senator Bishop refused to even read the bill that would let pharmacists tell people about lower-cost drugs even though it was shorter than ‘Green Eggs and Ham<em>,</em>’"" he said at the debate.</p>
<p>(We counted, and The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act comes in at about 200 words shorter than Dr. Seuss’s ""Green Eggs and Ham."")</p>
<p>When we asked the state senator’s campaign about his lack of preparation, Proud explained that the vote followed a debate on a workers’ compensation bill that Bishop authored. The General Assembly’s website shows that <a href=""https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2017/S/451"">votes on The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act</a> and <a href=""https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2017/S/436"">Bishop’s workers’ compensation bill</a> occurred less than an hour apart.</p>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>McCready said Bishop was the only member of the House or Senate to vote against a bill allowing pharmacists to tell people about lower-cost drugs. The roll call confirms that is correct. </p>
<p>However, McCready ignores the fact that Bishop supported an identical version of the bill. That vote and his statements indicate he supports the policy.</p>

<p>""Some states are only getting 50 tests per day, and the Utah Jazz got 58?"" said Michael Dougherty, a senior writer for the National Review, in a <a href=""https://twitter.com/michaelbd/status/1238131956526784512"">March 12 tweet</a>.</p>

<p>We found that Dougherty’s claim lined up with the information that’s available, despite some murkiness around the number of tests that have been conducted across the country.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">How the Jazz got tests so quickly</div>
<p>After a sprinting medical staffer <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOX_CZEwVuM"">alerted</a> referees to Gobert’s confirmed infection minutes before the game was supposed to start, the state of Oklahoma quickly completed tests for 58 people close to the organization who had come in contact with Gobert. </p>
<p><a id=""see-figure-2-on-politifactcom""></a><iframe allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/tOX_CZEwVuM"" width=""560""></iframe></p>
<p>The results for those 58 people came back within nine to 10 hours, said Andy Larsen, a Jazz beat writer for the Salt Lake Tribune who was tested for having been in recent contact with Gobert.</p>
<p>The process was fast, with medical professionals taking throat and sinus swabs from the team personnel at the arena, Larsen said. ""It really only does take like two minutes,"" he said.</p>
<p>The specimens were then shipped to Oklahoma’s public health lab, where they were tested overnight using test kits provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Jaime Dukes, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma State Department of Health.</p>
<p>Dukes told us the Oklahoma lab has been running tests since March 6, and that the lab has completed roughly 150 tests since then, including the tests on the Jazz personnel. </p>
<p>That means many of the tests in Oklahoma were completed in one night. Dukes said that’s because Oklahoma has been following the CDC’s <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html"">case-definition requirements</a>, which <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/11/donald-trump/donald-trumps-wrong-claim-anybody-can-get-tested-c/"">currently say</a> that clinicians should use judgment to decide if a symptomatic patient should be tested.</p>
<p>Clinicians are supposed to prioritize people with serious symptoms, people who are older or have underlying medical conditions, and people who had close contact with a confirmed or suspected coronavirus patient or recently traveled to an affected area, <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html"">according to the CDC</a>.</p>
<p>""That honestly was the first incident we’ve had where 58 people at one time needed to be tested,"" Dukes said. ""We’ve been meeting the demand, but we are being very clear about our criteria for testing.""</p>
<p>NBA spokesman Tim Frank said Oklahoma health officials directed the Jazz testing without intervention from the NBA, and that there was ""nothing we did to accelerate it.""</p>
<p>But state epidemiologist Laurence Burnsed, speaking at a <a href=""https://youtu.be/gX2XzgHsFiQ?t=769"">March 12 press conference</a>, said the NBA has ""policies in place"" that helped Gobert get tested quickly. NBA team trainers regularly monitor players for illness and work with local physicians when needed, Burnsed said.</p>
<p>According to the <a href=""https://apnews.com/7adbd02d3930454f42adb11e8dcaa34b"">Associated Press</a>, a number of other NBA franchises are having employees self-quarantine or get tested after coming into contact with Gobert and Mitchell in recent weeks. </p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<div class=""pf_subheadline"">How many tests are being conducted per state?</div>
<p>It’s hard to precisely say how many tests the U.S. has administered, in part because the CDC has outsourced some responsibility to states as well as private, academic and commercial labs. There’s no centralized database tracking everything.</p>
<p>Testing in the U.S. was <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/04/lou-dobbs/lou-dobbs-says-united-states-screening-fewer-peopl/"">slowed</a> from the get-go by flaws with the government’s early test kits and barriers that have been relaxed but still limit who can get tested. </p>
<p>Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/news-events/speeches-fda-officials/coronavirus-covid-19-update-white-house-press-briefing-fda-commissioner-stephen-m-hahn-md-03072020"">said March 7</a> that public health labs have the ability to test a total of 75,000 people. </p>
<p>He also said 1.1 million tests had been shipped to private labs, with another roughly 1 million on the way and still more to come from other academic and commercial labs.</p>
<p>The U.S. took another step toward increasing its capabilities on March 13 when it <a href=""https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/03/13/hhs-funds-development-covid-19-diagnostic-tests.html"">gave</a> over $1 million to two companies to develop new, one-hour tests.</p>
<p>It’s not clear that those capabilities are being met, however. </p>
<p>According to a <a href=""https://twitter.com/COVID2019tests/status/1238451268185731074?s=20"">tracker</a> from the American Enterprise Institute, the different labs running tests throughout the U.S. should have been capable of cumulatively testing more than 25,000 per day, at least as of March 13. (Dougherty is also a visiting fellow at AEI.)</p>
<p><a id=""see-figure-3-on-politifactcom""></a></p><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Updated to reflect <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#coronavirus</a> testing lab capacity at Assurance Scientific Labs and increased capacity in CA public health labs, Stanford, and NorthShore University HealthSystems <a href=""https://t.co/mEZgrkHbUF"">pic.twitter.com/mEZgrkHbUF</a></p>— COVID-19 Test Capacity (@COVID2019tests) <a href=""https://twitter.com/COVID2019tests/status/1238451268185731074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">March 13, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async="""" charset=""utf-8"" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script>
<p>Plus, the number of tests isn’t the same as the number of people who have been tested. Not everyone <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/11/donald-trump/donald-trumps-wrong-claim-anybody-can-get-tested-c/"">seeking a coronavirus test</a> can get one. Even sick people <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/us/coronavirus-testing-challenges.html"">have been denied</a>.</p>
<p>As of March 12, the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing-in-us.html"">CDC’s website</a> said it had tested roughly 3,903 specimens in CDC labs, plus about 9,721 in public health labs across the U.S.’s various states. </p>
<p>Those numbers, while incomplete, <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/04/lou-dobbs/lou-dobbs-says-united-states-screening-fewer-peopl/"">pale in comparison</a> with countries like South Korea, which ramped up testing weeks ago by setting up drive-thru screening clinics.</p>
<p>""Widespread testing was a key component of China and South Korea's response strategy,"" said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""Both countries have made significant progress in controlling their outbreaks.""</p>
<p>The U.S. pace has been more sluggish. Dougherty told us his claim could be traced to early March reports from <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-many-americans-have-been-tested-coronavirus/607597/"">the Atlantic</a> and <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/coronavirus-testing-by-state"">Buzzfeed News</a>, which said public health labs in states such as Hawaii and Arkansas were capable at the time of running fewer than 50 tests per day.</p>
<p>Dougherty also cited a recent report from <a href=""https://news.yahoo.com/cdc-tested-only-77-people-this-week-coronavirus-testing-slow-around-the-nation-153646616.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvL0h3bmpNaG5EOTQ_YW1wPTE&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHYj9pNUt_SXUEc2zlgY6MdZKC9Uj5KDut6YARxCvyRvfEeIo4vHo9v-IVB_PyLUptTHWhkE4jjg4Aap57hAq2MJX7nasfVFM6mMYt5Hbg9QH-kbsLjX_4yORwOrIUXcUT1HjM0VGxFf9Hz012Etj5wc3TAO5MJamba0XkIR9Ok5"">Yahoo News</a>, which relied on <a href=""https://covidtracking.com/notes/"">state</a> and federal data from the <a href=""https://covidtracking.com/"">COVID Tracking Project</a>, a <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/03/how-understand-your-states-coronavirus-numbers/607921/"">project of the Atlantic</a> run by reporters and data scientists. </p>
<p>The project <a href=""https://covidtracking.com/about-tracker/"">tracks</a> the numbers presented on state government websites to provide a more accurate overall testing count. (While the CDC website highlights the number of specimens tested, the COVID Tracking Project tracks the number of people.)</p>
<p>The Yahoo News article noted that the COVID Tracking Project <a href=""https://twitter.com/COVID19Tracking/status/1237836295017091072"">counted</a> 2,728 people tested by states and the District of Columbia on March 10, for an average of less than 55 per state. Some states <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18oVRrHj3c183mHmq3m89_163yuYltLNlOmPerQ18E8w/htmlview?sle=true#"">tested</a> fewer than 50 that day, according to the project’s tally. The project reported that 2,219 people were tested by states on March 11, or roughly 43 people per state.</p>

</div>]","The novel coronavirus reached the NBA this week, with Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert testing positive in Oklahoma City moments before the Jazz were set to tip off against the Thunder.
The development led the NBA to suspend its season. The Jazz said in a statement that after diagnostic tests were administered to team players, staff and traveling beat reporters, only one of the reported 58 people tested in connection with Gobert — guard Donovan Mitchell, who confirmed his positive test on Instagram — was found to be carrying COVID-19.
The Jazz’s quick access to 58 coronavirus tests seemed at odds with the fact that the United States has lagged behind other countries where testing has been more widespread. 
""Some states are only getting 50 tests per day, and the Utah Jazz got 58?"" said Michael Dougherty, a senior writer for the National Review, in a March 12 tweet.
Some states are only getting 50 tests per day, and the Utah Jazz got 58? If tests are going to remain scarce, how they're distributed will be a subject not just of controversy, but of fury and reprisal. https://t.co/Eip3nNOOXR— Michael Brendan Dougherty (@michaelbd) March 12, 2020 
We wondered how the Jazz team personnel got their hands on COVID-19 tests in a matter of hours, and what kind of access states have had to testing by comparison.
We found that Dougherty’s claim lined up with the information that’s available, despite some murkiness around the number of tests that have been conducted across the country.
How the Jazz got tests so quickly
After a sprinting medical staffer alerted referees to Gobert’s confirmed infection minutes before the game was supposed to start, the state of Oklahoma quickly completed tests for 58 people close to the organization who had come in contact with Gobert. 

The results for those 58 people came back within nine to 10 hours, said Andy Larsen, a Jazz beat writer for the Salt Lake Tribune who was tested for having been in recent contact with Gobert.
The process was fast, with medical professionals taking throat and sinus swabs from the team personnel at the arena, Larsen said. ""It really only does take like two minutes,"" he said.
The specimens were then shipped to Oklahoma’s public health lab, where they were tested overnight using test kits provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Jaime Dukes, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma State Department of Health.
Dukes told us the Oklahoma lab has been running tests since March 6, and that the lab has completed roughly 150 tests since then, including the tests on the Jazz personnel. 
That means many of the tests in Oklahoma were completed in one night. Dukes said that’s because Oklahoma has been following the CDC’s case-definition requirements, which currently say that clinicians should use judgment to decide if a symptomatic patient should be tested.
Clinicians are supposed to prioritize people with serious symptoms, people who are older or have underlying medical conditions, and people who had close contact with a confirmed or suspected coronavirus patient or recently traveled to an affected area, according to the CDC.
""That honestly was the first incident we’ve had where 58 people at one time needed to be tested,"" Dukes said. ""We’ve been meeting the demand, but we are being very clear about our criteria for testing.""
NBA spokesman Tim Frank said Oklahoma health officials directed the Jazz testing without intervention from the NBA, and that there was ""nothing we did to accelerate it.""
But state epidemiologist Laurence Burnsed, speaking at a March 12 press conference, said the NBA has ""policies in place"" that helped Gobert get tested quickly. NBA team trainers regularly monitor players for illness and work with local physicians when needed, Burnsed said.
According to the Associated Press, a number of other NBA franchises are having employees self-quarantine or get tested after coming into contact with Gobert and Mitchell in recent weeks.

How many tests are being conducted per state?
It’s hard to precisely say how many tests the U.S. has administered, in part because the CDC has outsourced some responsibility to states as well as private, academic and commercial labs. There’s no centralized database tracking everything.
Testing in the U.S. was slowed from the get-go by flaws with the government’s early test kits and barriers that have been relaxed but still limit who can get tested. 
Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said March 7 that public health labs have the ability to test a total of 75,000 people. 
He also said 1.1 million tests had been shipped to private labs, with another roughly 1 million on the way and still more to come from other academic and commercial labs.
The U.S. took another step toward increasing its capabilities on March 13 when it gave over $1 million to two companies to develop new, one-hour tests.
It’s not clear that those capabilities are being met, however. 
According to a tracker from the American Enterprise Institute, the different labs running tests throughout the U.S. should have been capable of cumulatively testing more than 25,000 per day, at least as of March 13. (Dougherty is also a visiting fellow at AEI.)

Plus, the number of tests isn’t the same as the number of people who have been tested. Not everyone seeking a coronavirus test can get one. Even sick people have been denied.
As of March 12, the CDC’s website said it had tested roughly 3,903 specimens in CDC labs, plus about 9,721 in public health labs across the U.S.’s various states. 
Those numbers, while incomplete, pale in comparison with countries like South Korea, which ramped up testing weeks ago by setting up drive-thru screening clinics.
""Widespread testing was a key component of China and South Korea's response strategy,"" said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""Both countries have made significant progress in controlling their outbreaks.""
The U.S. pace has been more sluggish. Dougherty told us his claim could be traced to early March reports from the Atlantic and Buzzfeed News, which said public health labs in states such as Hawaii and Arkansas were capable at the time of running fewer than 50 tests per day.
Dougherty also cited a recent report from Yahoo News, which relied on state and federal data from the COVID Tracking Project, a project of the Atlantic run by reporters and data scientists. 
The project tracks the numbers presented on state government websites to provide a more accurate overall testing count. (While the CDC website highlights the number of specimens tested, the COVID Tracking Project tracks the number of people.)
The Yahoo News article noted that the COVID Tracking Project counted 2,728 people tested by states and the District of Columbia on March 10, for an average of less than 55 per state. Some states tested fewer than 50 that day, according to the project’s tally. The project reported that 2,219 people were tested by states on March 11, or roughly 43 people per state.
Our daily 4pm ET update is out. The topline number is not good: ~10000 people tested, according to our state-level data, which cannot track all negative tests. That's a smaller day-over-day increase than yesterday.The ramp is not happening fast enough. https://t.co/Zc39AZVRge pic.twitter.com/2UfGBYOifc— The COVID Tracking Project (@COVID19Tracking) March 12, 2020 
",PolitiFact,"
Dougherty said ""some states are only getting 50 tests per day, and the Utah Jazz got 58.""
Oklahoma public health officials quickly completed tests on 58 people who had had recent contact with Gobert, the Jazz’s center, after he tested positive for COVID-19. 
It’s not clear how many tests each state is running per day. But Dougherty’s claim that ""some states are only getting 50 tests per day"" lines up with what had been reported at the time the claim was made.
We rate this statement True.

<p>Budd represents North Carolina’s 13th Congressional District, which covers much of the Greensboro-High Point area as well as the mostly rural area south of Winston-Salem and north of Charlotte. Manning is an attorney, and Budd has criticized her for donating more than $500,000 to the Democratic Party and its candidates.</p>

<p>It concludes: ""From her castle, it’s no surprise Queen Kathy doesn’t care about doubling parking rates for workers and commuters because Kathy Manning makes government work for her and we pay the price.""</p>

<p>The $30 million isn’t pure profit for developers. It’s to pay developers to build the deck. That includes material, labor and other costs.</p>
<p>""Under the reimbursement agreement, the developer will build a new public parking deck for the City in conjunction with the development of their hotel project. Once complete, the City will fully own and operate the new public parking deck,"" Keys said in an email.</p>
<p><strong>An overestimation</strong></p>
<p>The city would own the deck and spend an estimated <a href=""https://www.greensboro-nc.gov/departments/transportation/gdot-divisions/business-parking/parking/general-information/parking-deck-development"" target=""_blank"">$2.6 million a year</a> to maintain it and pay down the debt, according to the city’s website. The operating cost will include general deck maintenance, cleaning it and keeping the lights on, Keys said. The city would raise yearly parking spot rental rates from $65 to $128 by 2025, according to another <a href=""https://www.greensboro.com/news/local_news/monthly-parking-fees-in-downtown-greensboro-could-almost-double-by/article_5ce52d1b-d60e-586f-a41d-7b1630a2659f.html"" target=""_blank"">News &amp; Record story</a> provided by the Budd campaign.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t go to Kaplan’s group, either, Keys said.</p>
<p>""The City will maintain the deck, thus any amount (whether it is $2.3M or much less) will be completely an internal expense of the City paid for through revenues associated with the deck,"" he wrote. ""In the end, the hotel will pay for parking spaces in the City owned and operated deck just as any other business or individual.""</p>
<p>Whatever money Kaplan does receive from the project will be donated to the Community Foundation of Greater Greensboro, the <a href=""https://cfgg.org/blog/donor-story-randall-kaplan"">foundation announced</a> on Aug. 21.</p>
<p>""The donations will be used to support a range of charitable programs, including economic and workforce development, health care, education, arts, poverty alleviation and social services in the Central Piedmont region of North Carolina and elsewhere,"" the foundation wrote on its website.</p>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>Budd’s ad said Kathy Manning got $30 million ""of your tax dollars plus $2.3 million a year"" from a luxury hotel and parking lot. While Manning’s husband was involved in the project, Manning was not. And the $30 million represents the entire cost of the parking deck project — not gross profit for Manning or her husband. In fact, Kaplan is donating his profits. And the $2.3 million isn’t going to Manning or her husband’s group, either. We rate this claim False.</p>

Donald Trump ad says illegal immigrants would be collecting Social Security under Hillary Clinton
</h2>
</header>
<div adbridg-ad-class=""mobileinterstitial""></div>
<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>Donald Trump's <a href=""http://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_hillaryclinton_donaldtrump_ef7zx/"">first ad of the general election campaign</a> focuses on immigration, predicting what will happen if Hillary Clinton is elected.</p>
<p>""In Hillary Clinton's America,"" it warns, ""illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay, collecting Social Security benefits, skipping the line. Our border open, it's more of the same, but worse.""</p>
<p>We've previously looked at whether illegal immigrants convicted of crimes get to stay in the United States, a statement that rates <a href=""http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/aug/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-wants-let-crimin/"">Half True</a>. But what about his other claim about immigrants getting Social Security?</p>
<p>If you take the Trump ad literally, it is accusing Clinton of wanting illegal immigrants convicted of crimes to stay in the United States and collect Social Security benefits — an easily disprovable assertion.</p>
<p>Instead, for this fact-check, we’ll examine another interpretation: whether a Clinton administration would have Social Security benefit checks going to the 11 million people currently in the United States illegally. This reading dovetails with information cited by the ad, an <a href=""http://cis.org/miano/implications-united-states-v-texas"">article</a> by the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors strict immigration policies.</p>
<p>There's some truth to that argument that immigrants would be getting Social Security benefits under policies favored by Clinton. But, like all things related to immigration, it can get complicated.</p>
<p>Let's take this a step at a time.</p>
<p>Undocumented residents can remain in the United States without fear of deportation if given ""deferred action"" designation by the Homeland Security Department. That means, in essence, we know you're here, we know you're undocumented, but we're not going to deport you for now.</p>
<p>It's a temporary designation that must be renewed every two years. It doesn't make them citizens or legal; they can be deported if they are convicted of a felony, a serious misdemeanor or multiple misdemeanors, excluding traffic tickets. But if they behave themselves (and the government keeps renewing their ""deferred"" designation), they get to stay.</p>
<p>This ""deferred action"" status alone does not make them eligible for Social Security or most other federal benefits.</p>
<p>Once they have a deferred action designation, they are also given permission to work. The idea is, if we're willing to let you stay, you should be able to make a living and do it without being exploited by unscrupulous employers.</p>
<p>In the past, the deferred action designation has been granted to groups like victims of human trafficking, foreign students affected by a natural disaster, or family members of citizens killed in combat.</p>
<p>People with a deferred action are considered to be ""lawfully present"" in the United States, but only for the purpose of work authorization.</p>
<p>They are not eligible for food stamps, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income or other federal entitlement benefits available to citizens and people considered lawful permanent residents.</p>
<p>However, they are not barred from federal programs associated with working in the United States, such as Social Security and Medicare, where a portion of income goes toward funding the benefits.</p>
<p>This is nothing new. Congress and President Ronald Reagan <a href=""http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/02/symposium-back-to-immigration-basics-why-the-dapadaca-case-is-simpler-than-it-seems/"">set up this system in 1986</a>. It was updated in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>To be eligible for Social Security, the program Trump is focusing on, a person would have to pay into the system for at least 10 years and, like everyone else, couldn't start collecting until retirement age.</p>
<p>But first they have to be given that ""deferred action"" designation, which brings us to two Obama administration programs designed to do precisely that. Both are supported by Clinton. Neither have been passed by Congress.</p>
<p>The first is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It took effect in 2012 and has given deferred action designations to nearly 730,000 people who came to the United States as children and have lived here since 2007.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>As a practical matter, the children and young adults put into the deferred action category by DACA — and who start working — aren't going to be covered by Social Security for decades. That would be long after a Hillary Clinton administration — if there is one — has come and gone. As the Washington Post's Fact Checker <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/20/trumps-false-claim-that-undocumented-immigrants-collect-social-security-benefits/"">noted</a>, ""if Clinton serves two terms and leaves office in 2025, the oldest DACA grantees would be 43.""</p>
<p>The second program supported by Clinton is the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/mar/05/david-jolly/federal-judge-called-obama-immigration-action-unco/"">DAPA</a>. It would have given deferred action designations to as many as 4 million of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants. It would have applied to people whose children are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. Their designations would have to be renewed every three years. It would let them apply for work permits if they passed background checks and paid a fee.</p>
<p>Unlike DACA, this program has not taken effect because 26 states <a href=""http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/supreme-court-dapa-ruling-blow-obama-administration-moves-immigration-back-political-realm"">challenged it</a>. A 4-4 Supreme Court decision blocked its implementation. That legal fight has also blocked an expansion of DACA.</p>
<p>Because Clinton has vowed to <a href=""https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/immigration-reform/"">defend both programs</a>, Trump argues that illegal immigrants would get to collect Social Security if Clinton had her way.</p>
<p>But there are a few things to remember.</p>
<p>Granting deferred action to someone who came into the United States illegally means they have a ""lawful presence"" in the United States. They are still considered to be in the country illegally. (""Lawful presence"" is often confused with ""lawful status"" or ""legal status,"" which means you are not in the U.S. illegally.)</p>
<p>""They are getting a deferral of deportation, not a legal status,"" said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute. ""Only Congress can grant a legal status. Work authorization comes with the package when they get deferral, but by itself does not confer legality.""</p>
<p>Even if Clinton succeeds in implementing DAPA, these undocumented workers won't be eligible for any Social Security benefits for a minimum of 10 years. That's how long you have to work to be eligible. (Again, the children and young adults covered under DACA wouldn't be eligible for a Social Security retirement check until much later.)</p>
<p>If Clinton were elected and subsequently re-elected, she would be gone from office for nearly two years before anyone would start collecting, and the amount they received would be tied to the amount they were taxed.</p>
<p>And that assumes Clinton's successor continues the DAPA and DACA programs.</p>
<p>In addition, these immigrants would have been working legally for a long time. They might not have become citizens or permanent residents, but they would have been working in the country legally for at least a decade, paying taxes and contributing to the Social Security Trust Funds.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that undocumented workers <a href=""https://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/pdf_notes/note151.pdf"">paid about $13 billion</a> into Social Security in 2010 while the program paid those workers only about $1 billion in benefits, including people who have overstayed their visas or who obtained a Social Security number through fraudulent means. That extra $12 billion per year is money those workers would have a hard time claiming.</p>
<p>We didn't hear back from the Trump campaign, but Trump's policy director, Stephen Miller, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/20/trumps-false-claim-that-undocumented-immigrants-collect-social-security-benefits/"">responded to the Washington Post</a>, which ruled on the question of whether immigrants can collect Social Security benefits now, by saying that the net payments made to Social Security ""will be dwarfed by net withdrawals"" by people under DAPA and DACA. Our request for documentation to support that assertion went unanswered.</p>
<p>But <a href=""https://www.ssa.gov/oact/testimony/SenateHomeSec_20150204.pdf"">a 2015 report</a> by the Social Security Administration says Miller is wrong. It projected that DACA and DAPA would initially increase the solvency of Social Security — which is due to run out of money in 2033 — by about three months. It would produce a small overall increase in revenue through 2045, a smaller overall decline from 2046 through 2082 and be neutral after 2082.</p>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>Trump says in his television ad that, under a Clinton presidency, illegal immigrants would get to collect Social Security benefits.</p>
<p>It is correct that Clinton has supported plans to give many undocumented immigrants the right to stay in the country through deferred action, which has already been done under the Obama administration's DACA program. As a consequence of that, they are allowed to work and become part of the Social Security system under rules that have long been in place.</p>
<p>But Trump's ad gets at none of that nuance, instead insinuating that all illegal immigrants would be getting immediate handouts under Clinton's presidency.</p>
<p>Even if the broader DAPA program were to be adopted today, it would take a minimum of 10 years of working — and paying into the Social Security system — before these immigrants would be able to start getting their retirement money back. With few exceptions, the first payments wouldn't be collected until after Clinton leaves office.</p>
<p>Trump's statement has an element of truth but gives a misleading impression that all illegal immigrants will be getting Social Security paychecks during a Clinton administration. We rate the statement Mostly False. </p>

</div>]","Donald Trump's first ad of the general election campaign focuses on immigration, predicting what will happen if Hillary Clinton is elected.
""In Hillary Clinton's America,"" it warns, ""illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay, collecting Social Security benefits, skipping the line. Our border open, it's more of the same, but worse.""
We've previously looked at whether illegal immigrants convicted of crimes get to stay in the United States, a statement that rates Half True. But what about his other claim about immigrants getting Social Security?
If you take the Trump ad literally, it is accusing Clinton of wanting illegal immigrants convicted of crimes to stay in the United States and collect Social Security benefits — an easily disprovable assertion.
Instead, for this fact-check, we’ll examine another interpretation: whether a Clinton administration would have Social Security benefit checks going to the 11 million people currently in the United States illegally. This reading dovetails with information cited by the ad, an article by the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors strict immigration policies.
There's some truth to that argument that immigrants would be getting Social Security benefits under policies favored by Clinton. But, like all things related to immigration, it can get complicated.
Let's take this a step at a time.
Undocumented residents can remain in the United States without fear of deportation if given ""deferred action"" designation by the Homeland Security Department. That means, in essence, we know you're here, we know you're undocumented, but we're not going to deport you for now.
It's a temporary designation that must be renewed every two years. It doesn't make them citizens or legal; they can be deported if they are convicted of a felony, a serious misdemeanor or multiple misdemeanors, excluding traffic tickets. But if they behave themselves (and the government keeps renewing their ""deferred"" designation), they get to stay.
This ""deferred action"" status alone does not make them eligible for Social Security or most other federal benefits.
Once they have a deferred action designation, they are also given permission to work. The idea is, if we're willing to let you stay, you should be able to make a living and do it without being exploited by unscrupulous employers.
In the past, the deferred action designation has been granted to groups like victims of human trafficking, foreign students affected by a natural disaster, or family members of citizens killed in combat.
People with a deferred action are considered to be ""lawfully present"" in the United States, but only for the purpose of work authorization.
They are not eligible for food stamps, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income or other federal entitlement benefits available to citizens and people considered lawful permanent residents.
However, they are not barred from federal programs associated with working in the United States, such as Social Security and Medicare, where a portion of income goes toward funding the benefits.
This is nothing new. Congress and President Ronald Reagan set up this system in 1986. It was updated in the late 1990s.
To be eligible for Social Security, the program Trump is focusing on, a person would have to pay into the system for at least 10 years and, like everyone else, couldn't start collecting until retirement age.
But first they have to be given that ""deferred action"" designation, which brings us to two Obama administration programs designed to do precisely that. Both are supported by Clinton. Neither have been passed by Congress.
The first is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It took effect in 2012 and has given deferred action designations to nearly 730,000 people who came to the United States as children and have lived here since 2007.

<p>In fact, the post gives itself away. Beneath the logo for the biological research lab identified in the image is the company’s real name, Shang Hai Ruilan Bao Hu San Biotech Limited.</p>
<p>The company does have a blue-and-white logo that closely resembles the red-and-white logo from the fictional lab in ""Resident Evil."" But according to the <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20200302220218/http://www.ruiblue.com/about/"">company’s website</a>, the lab is based in Shanghai, which is more than 500 miles by car away from Wuhan, per <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Wuhan,+Hubei,+China/Shanghai,+China/@30.9962367,115.6479626,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x342eaef8dd85f26f:0x39c2c9ac6c582210!2m2!1d114.305539!2d30.592849!1m5!1m1!1s0x35b27040b1f53c33:0x295129423c364a1!2m2!1d121.473701!2d31.230416!4e1"">Google Maps</a>. </p>

</div>]","An image making the rounds on social media draws a supposedly eerie connection between the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China, and the fictional virus that triggers the dangerous mutations at the center of the plot for ""Resident Evil,"" a Japanese video-game series.
The image says that the fictional lab responsible for the virus in the ""Resident Evil"" franchise has the same logo as a real-life lab in Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected.
The problem with that claim: The Chinese lab with that logo is actually based in Shanghai, a roughly nine-hour drive from Wuhan. 
""In ‘Resident Evil’ the Umbrella Corporation releases a virus that infects the people of Raccoon City,"" the image, posted to Facebook as early as Jan. 27, says. ""A biological research lab with the exact same logo as the Umbrella Corporation can be found in the city where the coronavirus outbreak originated. Corona is an anagram for Racoon.""

A screenshot of a Facebook post about the coronavirus and a fictional lab from the ""Resident Evil"" video game. We rate this claim False.",PolitiFact,"
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Without getting too far into the details of ""Resident Evil,"" it’s clear that the post is inaccurate, as other fact-checkers have noted.
In fact, the post gives itself away. Beneath the logo for the biological research lab identified in the image is the company’s real name, Shang Hai Ruilan Bao Hu San Biotech Limited.
The company does have a blue-and-white logo that closely resembles the red-and-white logo from the fictional lab in ""Resident Evil."" But according to the company’s website, the lab is based in Shanghai, which is more than 500 miles by car away from Wuhan, per Google Maps. 
What’s more, there’s no evidence that the novel 2019 coronavirus was created in a lab. We’ve debunked a number of claims — like the Facebook post in question — that suggested the new virus was artificially made in Wuhan or elsewhere.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the new coronavirus is a ""beta coronavirus"" similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS. All three viruses are believed to have their origins in bats.
We rate this post False.

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>A death hoax has been circulating for months that actor Kirk Douglas died.</p>
<p>""Legendary actor Kirk Douglas dead, 4 days before his 101st birthday,"" stated a <a href=""http://actionnews3.com/legendary-actor-kirk-douglas-dead-age-100/"">headline</a> by Your Action News 3 which has circulated since <a href=""https://www.snopes.com/kirk-douglas-death-hoax/"">December</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that the <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/top-10-kirk-douglas-films-worth-watching-1002768/item/kirk-douglas-films-champion-1949-1002780"">famous movie star</a> had died.</p>
<p>The fake story said that Douglas died of natural causes and that his family released a statement saying he ""went comfortably and was in no pain"" and ""lived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.""</p>
<p>In 2014, People magazine <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/01/people-magazine-kirk-douglas-obit_n_6246358.html?ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000063"">accidentally published</a> the actor’s obituary on its website.</p>
<p>""DO NOT PUB Kirk Douglas Dies"" the headline read. The magazine removed the obit from it's website after reports about the premature obit circulated on social media. Many news organizations pre-write obits of famous people.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>We searched for mainstream news reports about Douglas and found no reports that he had died. When Douglas turned 101 in December, the <em><a href=""https://dailygazette.com/article/2017/12/08/kirk-douglas-to-turn-101-celebrate-with-party"">Daily Gazette</a></em> in Schenectady, N.Y., where the actor’s sister lives quoted the actor’s niece Marilyn Gordon.</p>
<p>""Uncle Kirk is doing great,"" Gordon said. ""They're going to have a big party for him (Saturday).""</p>
<p>Douglas survived a <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-14/local/me-1592_1_santa-paula-airport"">helicopter crash in 1991 </a>and a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/12/kirk-douglas-i-never-thought-id-live-to-100-thats-shocked-me"">stroke in 1996</a>.</p>
<p>""I never, ever thought I would live to be 100. That’s shocked me, really. And it’s sad, too,"" he said in a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/12/kirk-douglas-i-never-thought-id-live-to-100-thats-shocked-me"">2017 interview</a>.</p>
<p>We sent an email to Your Action News 3 and did not get a reply. Our fact-checking friends at Snopes have debunked other death hoaxes by the same website about <a href=""https://www.snopes.com/morgan-freeman-death-hoax/"">Morgan Freeman</a>, <a href=""https://www.snopes.com/bob-barker-dead/"">Bob Barker</a>, and <a href=""https://www.snopes.com/george-zimmerman-found-dead/"">George Zimmerman</a>.</p>

</div>]","A death hoax has been circulating for months that actor Kirk Douglas died.
""Legendary actor Kirk Douglas dead, 4 days before his 101st birthday,"" stated a headline by Your Action News 3 which has circulated since December.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that the famous movie star had died.
The fake story said that Douglas died of natural causes and that his family released a statement saying he ""went comfortably and was in no pain"" and ""lived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.""
In 2014, People magazine accidentally published the actor’s obituary on its website.
""DO NOT PUB Kirk Douglas Dies"" the headline read. The magazine removed the obit from it's website after reports about the premature obit circulated on social media. Many news organizations pre-write obits of famous people.",PolitiFact,"
We searched for mainstream news reports about Douglas and found no reports that he had died. When Douglas turned 101 in December, the Daily Gazette in Schenectady, N.Y., where the actor’s sister lives quoted the actor’s niece Marilyn Gordon.
""Uncle Kirk is doing great,"" Gordon said. ""They're going to have a big party for him (Saturday).""
Douglas survived a helicopter crash in 1991 and a stroke in 1996.
""I never, ever thought I would live to be 100. That’s shocked me, really. And it’s sad, too,"" he said in a 2017 interview.
We sent an email to Your Action News 3 and did not get a reply. Our fact-checking friends at Snopes have debunked other death hoaxes by the same website about Morgan Freeman, Bob Barker, and George Zimmerman.
Douglas is still alive, despite a fake story that said he was dead. We rate this story Pants on Fire.

<html><body><p>Democrats have complained loudly about the unfairness of an election-year Supreme Court selection for President Donald Trump when President Barack Obama was denied the same opportunity.</p>
<p>But now that Trump has named a candidate, they’re also worried about her positions on the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature health care law. </p>
<p>Joe Biden, Obama’s vice president and now the Democratic presidential nominee, spoke about it in remarks he made on the Supreme Court on Sept. 27. </p>
<p>""It should come as no surprise that President Trump would nominate Judge Amy Coney Barrett,"" Biden said. ""She has a written track record, disagreeing adamantly with the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the ACA. In fact, she publicly criticized Chief Justice Roberts’ opinion upholding the law eight years ago.""</p>
<p>We decided to look into the evidence. We found that Barrett hasn’t written a lot about the Affordable Care Act, but what she has written has been decidedly negative about the Supreme Court’s 2012 ruling upholding its constitutionality. </p>
<p>Her most extensive writing on the Affordable Care Act that we found was a 2017 book review titled, ""Countering the Majoritarian Difficulty."" The book review focused on judicial restraint and when courts should invalidate laws passed by legislatures.</p>
<p>Barrett’s writing suggests sympathy with Supreme Court justices who are both ""originalists"" and ""textualists,"" best exemplified by Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, who objected to the majority view that upheld the Affordable Care Act in two cases: the National Federation of Business (NFIB) vs. Sibelius and and the later King vs. Burwell. </p>
<p>Those cases, upheld by Chief Justice John Roberts and the court’s left-leaning justices, found the law constitutional because it ultimately depended on the federal government’s taxing authority to compel people to buy insurance (called the individual mandate). Scalia argued that was wrong because, among other things, the law itself called the tax a penalty.</p>
<p>Barrett’s review said that Roberts ""has not proven himself to be a textualist in matters of statutory interpretation.""</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>Her writing also suggested she sided with Scalia: ""To the extent that NFIB v. Sebelius expresses a commitment to judicial restraint by creatively interpreting ostensibly clear statutory text, its approach is at odds with the statutory textualism to which most originalists subscribe. Thus Justice Scalia, criticizing the majority’s construction of the Affordable Care Act in both NFIB v. Sebelius and King v. Burwell, protested that the statute known as Obamacare should be renamed ‘SCOTUScare’ in honor of the court’s willingness to ‘rewrite’ the statute in order to keep it afloat."" </p>
<p>The Washington Post <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/barrett-supreme-court-trump/2020/09/26/20863794-feac-11ea-830c-a160b331ca62_story.html"">cited an interview</a> with Barrett in 2015 on the radio program ""On Point,"" in which Barrett said of the decision that ""it’s clearly a good result that these millions of Americans won’t lose their tax subsidies,"" but ""the dissent has the better of the legal argument."" (We were unable to find a transcript or recording of the complete interview.)</p>

</div>]","Democrats have complained loudly about the unfairness of an election-year Supreme Court selection for President Donald Trump when President Barack Obama was denied the same opportunity.
But now that Trump has named a candidate, they’re also worried about her positions on the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature health care law. 
Joe Biden, Obama’s vice president and now the Democratic presidential nominee, spoke about it in remarks he made on the Supreme Court on Sept. 27. 
""It should come as no surprise that President Trump would nominate Judge Amy Coney Barrett,"" Biden said. ""She has a written track record, disagreeing adamantly with the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the ACA. In fact, she publicly criticized Chief Justice Roberts’ opinion upholding the law eight years ago.""
We decided to look into the evidence. We found that Barrett hasn’t written a lot about the Affordable Care Act, but what she has written has been decidedly negative about the Supreme Court’s 2012 ruling upholding its constitutionality. 
Her most extensive writing on the Affordable Care Act that we found was a 2017 book review titled, ""Countering the Majoritarian Difficulty."" The book review focused on judicial restraint and when courts should invalidate laws passed by legislatures.
Barrett’s writing suggests sympathy with Supreme Court justices who are both ""originalists"" and ""textualists,"" best exemplified by Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, who objected to the majority view that upheld the Affordable Care Act in two cases: the National Federation of Business (NFIB) vs. Sibelius and and the later King vs. Burwell. 
Those cases, upheld by Chief Justice John Roberts and the court’s left-leaning justices, found the law constitutional because it ultimately depended on the federal government’s taxing authority to compel people to buy insurance (called the individual mandate). Scalia argued that was wrong because, among other things, the law itself called the tax a penalty.
Barrett’s review said that Roberts ""has not proven himself to be a textualist in matters of statutory interpretation.""

By Marta Campabadal Graus • May 18, 2023







Her writing also suggested she sided with Scalia: ""To the extent that NFIB v. Sebelius expresses a commitment to judicial restraint by creatively interpreting ostensibly clear statutory text, its approach is at odds with the statutory textualism to which most originalists subscribe. Thus Justice Scalia, criticizing the majority’s construction of the Affordable Care Act in both NFIB v. Sebelius and King v. Burwell, protested that the statute known as Obamacare should be renamed ‘SCOTUScare’ in honor of the court’s willingness to ‘rewrite’ the statute in order to keep it afloat."" 
The Washington Post cited an interview with Barrett in 2015 on the radio program ""On Point,"" in which Barrett said of the decision that ""it’s clearly a good result that these millions of Americans won’t lose their tax subsidies,"" but ""the dissent has the better of the legal argument."" (We were unable to find a transcript or recording of the complete interview.)
When President Trump nominated her as his selection to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barrett noted her close ties to Scalia and his judicial approach, calling him a mentor with an ""incalculable influence"" on her life and alluding to a textualist approach. 
""His judicial philosophy is mine, too: a judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold,"" she said.  
Finally, other liberal groups pointed to a letter Barrett signed along with many Catholic clergy, religious and legal experts that objected to the Obama administration’s policies on birth control and the Affordable Care Act. The letter argued that the administration was infringing on Catholic institutions’ religious liberty by requiring them to accommodate their employees’ access to contraception as part of health insurance.  
We reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign, but did not hear back.
",PolitiFact,"
Biden said that Barrett ""has a written track record, disagreeing adamantly with the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the ACA. In fact, she publicly criticized Chief Justice Roberts’ opinion upholding the law eight years ago.""
The track record we found is not very lengthy, and it is more academic than ""adamant."" But it is there, and it strongly suggests Barrett would have sided with Scalia over Roberts in finding the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional.  
We rate the statement Mostly True.

<html><body><p>The massive power outage in Texas that left millions with no heat amid frigid temperatures should have come as no surprise, according to former El Paso Congressman Beto O’Rourke.</p>
<p>""Texans are suffering without power because those in power have failed us,"" said O’Rourke in a <a href=""https://twitter.com/BetoORourke/status/1361827701011587073"">Twitter thread</a>, calling out Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.</p>
<p>""State leaders don’t get to say that they didn’t see this coming. Energy experts and State House Dems, among others, were warning of this for years. Abbott chose to ignore the facts, the science and the tough decisions and now Texans will once again pay the price,"" tweeted O’Rourke, a 2019 Democratic presidential candidate.</p>
<p>We found that O’Rourke spoke accurately — there had been years of warnings by energy experts about the state’s power system following cold weather in February 2011, when around 200 generating units faltered, causing power outages for 3.2 million customers, according to a <a href=""https://www.ferc.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/08-16-11-report.pdf"">post-mortem of that crisis</a>. </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Federal report warned about lack of winterization</div>
<p>In August 2011, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corp., wrote a 357-page<a href=""https://www.ferc.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/08-16-11-report.pdf""> report </a>about the February 2011 outage. </p>
<p>The report stated that in 1989, after cold weather caused many generators to fail, the Public Utility Commission of Texas issued a number of recommendations aimed at improving winterization of the generators. However, ""these recommendations were not mandatory, and over the course of time implementation lapsed. Many of the generators that experienced outages in 1989 failed again in 2011,"" the report stated.</p>
<p>The report found that in 2011 ""the generators did not adequately anticipate the full impact of the extended cold weather and high winds."" More thorough preparation for cold weather could have prevented many of the weather-related outages, the report found.</p>
<p>There are a lot of similarities between the deficiencies in the grid cited in the 2011 report and those now, said Dave Tuttle, an Energy Institute research associate at the University of Texas at Austin, in an interview with the <a href=""https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2021/02/17/state-energy-winter-protections-lacking-reports-have-suggested/6780847002/"">Austin American-Statesman</a>.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Some legislators filed bills intended to improve the state’s energy infrastructure</div>
<p>Following the 2011 blackout, state legislators held a <a href=""https://www.texastribune.org/2011/02/15/texas-senate-hears-blackout-testimony/"">hearing</a> where senators expressed surprise that Texas had outages when other areas of the country are able to keep power on during cold weather. </p>
<p>O’Rourke told us in a text message that one of the people who warned about the problems was Sylvester Turner, who was a state representative in 2011 and is now Houston’s mayor. Turner, a Democrat, authored <a href=""https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=82R&amp;Bill=HB1986"">HB 1986</a>, which called for the Public Utility Commission to ensure the Electric Reliability Council of Texas had adequate reserve power to prevent blackout conditions. ERCOT manages about 90% of the state’s electric load.</p>
<p>""Ironically that bill that I filed was not heard in committee,"" <a href=""https://twitter.com/TheLeadCNN/status/1362520870166683659"">Turner said this week on CNN</a>.</p>
<p>In 2011, the Legislature did pass a bill to <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Texas-grid-again-faces-scrutiny-over-cold-15955392.php"">require power companies</a> to submit reports to the Public Utility Commission about weatherization efforts. The author of that bill, Republican Glenn Hegar, who is now the state comptroller, questions whether the bill went far enough, according to a recent report in the <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Texas-grid-again-faces-scrutiny-over-cold-15955392.php"">Houston Chronicle</a>. </p>
<p>""I am extremely frustrated that 10 years later our electric grid remains so ill-equipped for these weather events,"" Hegar said.</p>
<p>The Texas House Democratic caucus cited some other bills that were intended at least in part to improve the state’s energy infrastructure that failed to pass or remain pending.

<p>One of the key experts who has raised concerns for years about ERCOT is <a href=""https://uh.edu/uh-energy/about-uh-energy/energy-fellows/blog-posts/ed-hirs/"">Ed Hirs</a>, a lecturer of energy economics at the University of Houston.</p>
<p>Following the 2011 mass outage, ""there were lots of reports and recommendations and lots of people waving their hands,"" but no substantial changes, Hirs told us. </p>
<p>Hirs sent us articles in which he raised alarms about Texas’ power setup dating back to <a href=""https://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Texas-suffers-from-Soviet-style-electricity-4301693.php"">2013</a>,   when he wrote that the state had a Soviet-style model that allowed ERCOT to essentially set prices across the state. </p>
<p>""ERCOT's problem with the model has been made evident in the rolling blackouts across Texas over the past several years,"" Hirs wrote in a 2013 Houston Chronicle op-ed with co-author Paul MacAvoy, an energy expert and Yale University professor emeritus.</p>
<p>""A recent letter from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation to ERCOT warns that projected near-future generating capacity is insufficient to meet growth in demand and points to the likelihood of significant shortfalls in electricity generation and delivery,"" they wrote. (Here is the<a href=""http://blogs.edf.org/texascleanairmatters/files/2013/01/NERC-Ltr-2-Trip-Doggett-on-Resource-Adequacy-dated-01.07.13.pdf""> letter</a>.)</p>
<p>Hirs raised similar alarms about ERCOT and blackouts in 2014 in a <a href=""https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/the-generation-gap/amp/"">Texas Monthly</a> article and in a 2019 op-ed in the <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/How-to-fix-Texas-Soviet-style-electricity-14363388.php"">Houston Chronicle</a>.</p>
<p>""The Texas electricity market is rife with market manipulation and major disincentives for generators to maintain a reliable supply of power,"" he wrote in 2019. ""The latest examples of this have become public in recent days, a state of affairs that costs Texas consumers real money each year.""</p>
<p>We asked spokespersons for Abbott if they had any evidence to refute O’Rourke’s statement about the warnings about the power problems for years. Renae Eze replied that O’Rourke was ""choosing to play politics"" but did not respond directly to our question. Abbott has declared <a href=""https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/16/texas-power-outage-ercot/"">reforming ERCOT</a> a priority for the current legislative session.</p>

<p>Experts have been warning about the failures of the state’s power grid for years, particularly after a 2011 cold spell. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corp. wrote an extensive report showing that recommendations following a 1989 outage weren’t implemented. Other experts have also warned for years about ERCOT and power blackouts, and state legislators tried to propose bills to improve the state’s energy infrastructure.</p>

</div>]","The massive power outage in Texas that left millions with no heat amid frigid temperatures should have come as no surprise, according to former El Paso Congressman Beto O’Rourke.
""Texans are suffering without power because those in power have failed us,"" said O’Rourke in a Twitter thread, calling out Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.
""State leaders don’t get to say that they didn’t see this coming. Energy experts and State House Dems, among others, were warning of this for years. Abbott chose to ignore the facts, the science and the tough decisions and now Texans will once again pay the price,"" tweeted O’Rourke, a 2019 Democratic presidential candidate.
We found that O’Rourke spoke accurately — there had been years of warnings by energy experts about the state’s power system following cold weather in February 2011, when around 200 generating units faltered, causing power outages for 3.2 million customers, according to a post-mortem of that crisis. 
Federal report warned about lack of winterization
In August 2011, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corp., wrote a 357-page report about the February 2011 outage. 
The report stated that in 1989, after cold weather caused many generators to fail, the Public Utility Commission of Texas issued a number of recommendations aimed at improving winterization of the generators. However, ""these recommendations were not mandatory, and over the course of time implementation lapsed. Many of the generators that experienced outages in 1989 failed again in 2011,"" the report stated.
The report found that in 2011 ""the generators did not adequately anticipate the full impact of the extended cold weather and high winds."" More thorough preparation for cold weather could have prevented many of the weather-related outages, the report found.
There are a lot of similarities between the deficiencies in the grid cited in the 2011 report and those now, said Dave Tuttle, an Energy Institute research associate at the University of Texas at Austin, in an interview with the Austin American-Statesman.
Some legislators filed bills intended to improve the state’s energy infrastructure
Following the 2011 blackout, state legislators held a hearing where senators expressed surprise that Texas had outages when other areas of the country are able to keep power on during cold weather. 
O’Rourke told us in a text message that one of the people who warned about the problems was Sylvester Turner, who was a state representative in 2011 and is now Houston’s mayor. Turner, a Democrat, authored HB 1986, which called for the Public Utility Commission to ensure the Electric Reliability Council of Texas had adequate reserve power to prevent blackout conditions. ERCOT manages about 90% of the state’s electric load.
""Ironically that bill that I filed was not heard in committee,"" Turner said this week on CNN.
In 2011, the Legislature did pass a bill to require power companies to submit reports to the Public Utility Commission about weatherization efforts. The author of that bill, Republican Glenn Hegar, who is now the state comptroller, questions whether the bill went far enough, according to a recent report in the Houston Chronicle. 
""I am extremely frustrated that 10 years later our electric grid remains so ill-equipped for these weather events,"" Hegar said.
The Texas House Democratic caucus cited some other bills that were intended at least in part to improve the state’s energy infrastructure that failed to pass or remain pending. Some bills pertain directly to the Public Utility Commission, which has oversight of ERCOT. One bill included a proposal to elect a member of the commission while another would have required state agencies to create strategic plans to account for expected changes in weather. A separate bill called for creating an agreement between ERCOT and an adjacent Mexican power grid for cross-border dispatch. This session, a legislator filed a bill to study the impacts of climate change.

<p>A third <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11047189/Up-300-000-people-Britain-unaware-potentially-deadly-heart-condition.html"">headline</a>, from July 25 in the Daily Mail, a British tabloid, said: ""Up to 300,000 Brits are unaware they may have potentially deadly heart condition … and many people have no symptoms at all."" But this story didn’t mention COVID-19 vaccines, either. ""The most common cause of aortic stenosis is wear and tear on the heart and it usually affects those aged over 65,"" the story said. </p>
<p>In June, the New York Post <a href=""https://nypost.com/2022/06/28/falling-asleep-with-the-tv-on-could-bring-early-death-study/"">reported</a> that ""falling asleep with the TV on could bring early death: study."" But this, too, was unrelated to COVID-19. The upshot: Researchers found that people who slept with ambient lighting, such as that from a television, were more likely to suffer from diabetes, obesity and hypertension, and could cause insulin resistance. </p>
<p>On July 29, the Daily Mirror, another British tabloid newspaper, published a <a href=""https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/university-student-dies-joy-after-27613873"">story</a> with this headline: ""University student ‘dies of joy’ after hearing he’d passed his exams with flying colours."" Mubarak Hussein Sayed Abdel-Jalil had a heart attack after the tests at his school in Egypt and died the same day, the Mirror said. But the story doesn’t mention COVID-19, or vaccines, and we found no other news reports tying his death to the vaccines. </p>
<p>Finally, there’s this July 1 Sun <a href=""https://www.the-sun.com/health/5681777/urgent-warning-gardeners-soil-increases-risk-killer/"">headline</a>: ""GREEN FINGERS: Urgent warning to gardeners as soil ‘increases risk of killer heart disease.’"" The health risk here was not from COVID-19 vaccines, but from pollutants in the soil such as heavy metals, pesticides and plastics that can stress blood vessels and lead to heart disease. </p>

""Don’t worry, it’s all just a big coincidence,"" reads text above images of the articles. 
""Clearly has nothing to do with the experimental jab that was forced on the majority of the population over the past year and a half,"" a post sharing the images said. ""Nope."" 
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
Let’s examine the articles. 
""Fabulous news,"" says one headline from a U.S. edition of the tabloid newspaper the Sun. ""Being sarcastic puts you at great risk of heart attack, docs warn."" The article was published Sept. 15, 2020, about three months before the first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine were available in the United States. 
Another headline was more current, from a July 25, 2022, CNN story that said ""Napping regularly linked to high blood pressure and stroke, study finds."" But the story mentioned neither the coronavirus nor COVID-19 nor vaccines.. One psychologist told CNN that ""although taking a nap itself is not harmful, many people who take naps may do so because of poor sleep at night,"" which is associated with poorer health. ",PolitiFact,"
A third headline, from July 25 in the Daily Mail, a British tabloid, said: ""Up to 300,000 Brits are unaware they may have potentially deadly heart condition … and many people have no symptoms at all."" But this story didn’t mention COVID-19 vaccines, either. ""The most common cause of aortic stenosis is wear and tear on the heart and it usually affects those aged over 65,"" the story said.

Mubarak Hussein Sayed Abdel-Jalil had a heart attack after the tests at his school in Egypt and died the same day, the Mirror said. But the story doesn’t mention COVID-19, or vaccines, and we found no other news reports tying his death to the vaccines. 
Finally, there’s this July 1 Sun headline: ""GREEN FINGERS: Urgent warning to gardeners as soil ‘increases risk of killer heart disease.’"" The health risk here was not from COVID-19 vaccines, but from pollutants in the soil such as heavy metals, pesticides and plastics that can stress blood vessels and lead to heart disease.

<html><body><p>As weeks of testimony come to a close in the murder trial for former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, questions over Chauvin’s use of force against George Floyd in the arrest that preceded Floyd’s death have spilled over onto social media.</p>
<p>Some Facebook and Instagram users said Floyd could not have been resisting arrest, because Chauvin had one hand in his own pocket as <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/apr/09/instagram-posts/instagram-post-ignores-full-floyd-video-falsely-cl/"">he kneeled on Floyd’s neck</a> for roughly nine minutes on May 25, 2020.</p>
<p>""If George Floyd were resisting, Chauvin's hands wouldn't have been in his pockets,"" said an April 6 Facebook <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10165003591975383&amp;set=a.10157483470610383&amp;type=3&amp;theater"">post</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10159063092716047&amp;set=a.249626671046&amp;type=3"">one</a> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CNa11iVh6FB/?utm_source=ig_embed"">of</a> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/585762384788906/posts/4105212216177221"">several</a> to make the claim.</p>
<p>The post and others like it were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related"">partnership with Facebook</a>.) </p>
<p>Several use-of-force experts and the Minneapolis police chief <a href=""https://www.startribune.com/derek-chauvin-murder-trial-george-floyd-minneapolis-police-what-happened-recap/600046459/?refresh=true"">testified during the trial</a> that Floyd was no longer resisting as he lay pinned under Chauvin’s knee, and that Chauvin should have cut off his restraint once Floyd, who repeatedly said he could not breathe, cried out in distress. Chauvin is charged with second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.</p>
<p>It’s not true, however, that Chauvin had his left hand in his pocket as he knelt on Floyd. </p>
<p>PolitiFact’s review of the roughly 10-minute bystander video that ignited months of racial justice protests found that Chauvin was wearing gloves that, like his pants, were a very dark color. A close review of photos taken as screen grabs of the video also show Chauvin’s hand on his thigh.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">The hand-in-pocket narrative is misguided</div>
<p>The claim that Chauvin had his hand in his pocket <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/799539910084929/posts/3185922554779974"">started circulating</a> on Facebook shortly after <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/may/29/death-george-floyd-what-you-need-know/"">Floyd’s death</a>, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. </p>
<p>As the trial has played out in recent weeks, those claims have resurfaced. Some news outlets have spread the narrative, USA Today <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/04/15/fact-check-chauvin-did-not-have-hand-pocket-floyds-arrest/7219674002/?fbclid=IwAR3j2MGkvhQFmoIpM5dS7cghPY2HPrSeb52AaErbTANQG3dC8PcxAIcwk9k"">reported</a>. And <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Rqm4wPk9g"">in a video</a>, Floyd’s brother Philonese said, ""He tortured my brother to death with a smirk on his face, with his hands in his pocket.""</p>
<p>The narrative also came up in court as Minneapolis firefighter <a href=""https://youtu.be/pdT7QMZ0F5A?t=388"">Genevieve Hansen testified</a> that she had tried to render medical aid to Floyd but was turned away by the police officers present. </p>
<p>""In my memory, (Chauvin) had his hand in his pocket, he looked so comfortable,"" Hansen said. </p>
<p>The prosecution asked Hansen if her assessment of Chauvin’s positioning would be different if Chauvin’s hand had been ""resting on his thigh"" rather than in his pocket. Hansen said no and that Chauvin seemed ""comfortable"" in the position he had taken to restrain Floyd regardless.</p>

<p>PolitiFact reviewed the roughly 10-minute video <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/darnellareallprettymarie/videos/1425398217661280/"">uploaded to Facebook by Darnella Frazier</a>, who later testified as a witness in Chauvin’s trial. Chauvin is visible for most but not all of the video. </p>
<p>The video Frazier posted to Facebook shows Chauvin wearing black gloves that appear to match the color of his pants. At various points in the video, Chauvin can be seen resting the knuckles of his left hand on his thigh while he pinned Floyd’s neck to the pavement with his knee. At other points, Chauvin can be seen placing his hand on his radio and other objects on the holster of his belt. </p>
<p>Police <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gQYMBALDXc"">body camera footage</a> of the incident does not always show Chauvin clearly.</p>
<p>Several of the social media posts claiming that Chauvin’s hand was in his pocket relied on screen grabs taken from Frazier’s video. The screen grabs on their own can be misleading, but a closer look reveals that the photos really show Chauvin’s gloves blended in with his pants.</p>
<p>Using image editing software, USA Today altered the brightness, exposure and vibrancy of the screen grabs to make the placement of Chauvin’s hand more visible. The enhanced version of the photo shows Chauvin’s knuckles resting against his thigh, with his fingers bent backwards.</p>
<p>Matthew Stamm, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Drexel University, is an expert on falsified images and videos. Stamm said USA Today’s techniques for enhancing the screen grab images were a legitimate way to visually interpret what they showed.</p>
<p>Stamm and researcher Brian Hosler also reviewed Frazier’s video for PolitiFact. From screen grabs that they took, they concluded that Chauvin’s hand was on his thigh, not in his pocket.</p>
<p>Several use-of-force experts and law enforcement personnel, including Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, said Floyd had stopped resisting before his breathing came to a halt.</p>
<p>""Once Mr. Floyd had stopped resisting — and certainly once he was in distress and trying to verbalize that — that should have stopped,"" <a href=""https://youtu.be/LkasN2WwjFA?t=120"">Arradondo said</a> of Chauvin’s use of force.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>Facebook posts said Chauvin had his left hand in his pocket while kneeling on George Floyd.</p>
<p>While some screen grabs taken from a bystander’s video appear to show that Chauvin had his left hand in his pocket as he pressed Floyd to the pavement, both the video itself and enhanced versions of the screen grabs indicate that his hand was actually on his thigh. </p>
<p>Chauvin was wearing black gloves during the incident that blended in with his dark pants.</p>

</div>]","As weeks of testimony come to a close in the murder trial for former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, questions over Chauvin’s use of force against George Floyd in the arrest that preceded Floyd’s death have spilled over onto social media.
Some Facebook and Instagram users said Floyd could not have been resisting arrest, because Chauvin had one hand in his own pocket as he kneeled on Floyd’s neck for roughly nine minutes on May 25, 2020.
""If George Floyd were resisting, Chauvin's hands wouldn't have been in his pockets,"" said an April 6 Facebook post, one of several to make the claim.
The post and others like it were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 
Several use-of-force experts and the Minneapolis police chief testified during the trial that Floyd was no longer resisting as he lay pinned under Chauvin’s knee, and that Chauvin should have cut off his restraint once Floyd, who repeatedly said he could not breathe, cried out in distress. Chauvin is charged with second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
It’s not true, however, that Chauvin had his left hand in his pocket as he knelt on Floyd. 
PolitiFact’s review of the roughly 10-minute bystander video that ignited months of racial justice protests found that Chauvin was wearing gloves that, like his pants, were a very dark color. A close review of photos taken as screen grabs of the video also show Chauvin’s hand on his thigh.
The hand-in-pocket narrative is misguided
The claim that Chauvin had his hand in his pocket started circulating on Facebook shortly after Floyd’s death, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. 
As the trial has played out in recent weeks, those claims have resurfaced. Some news outlets have spread the narrative, USA Today reported. And in a video, Floyd’s brother Philonese said, ""He tortured my brother to death with a smirk on his face, with his hands in his pocket.""
The narrative also came up in court as Minneapolis firefighter Genevieve Hansen testified that she had tried to render medical aid to Floyd but was turned away by the police officers present. 
""In my memory, (Chauvin) had his hand in his pocket, he looked so comfortable,"" Hansen said. 
The prosecution asked Hansen if her assessment of Chauvin’s positioning would be different if Chauvin’s hand had been ""resting on his thigh"" rather than in his pocket. Hansen said no and that Chauvin seemed ""comfortable"" in the position he had taken to restrain Floyd regardless.

In reality, Chauvin’s hand was on his thigh, USA Today first reported. It was not in his pocket.

PolitiFact reviewed the roughly 10-minute video uploaded to Facebook by Darnella Frazier, who later testified as a witness in Chauvin’s trial. Chauvin is visible for most but not all of the video. 
The video Frazier posted to Facebook shows Chauvin wearing black gloves that appear to match the color of his pants. At various points in the video, Chauvin can be seen resting the knuckles of his left hand on his thigh while he pinned Floyd’s neck to the pavement with his knee. At other points, Chauvin can be seen placing his hand on his radio and other objects on the holster of his belt. 
Police body camera footage of the incident does not always show Chauvin clearly.
Several of the social media posts claiming that Chauvin’s hand was in his pocket relied on screen grabs taken from Frazier’s video. The screen grabs on their own can be misleading, but a closer look reveals that the photos really show Chauvin’s gloves blended in with his pants.
Using image editing software, USA Today altered the brightness, exposure and vibrancy of the screen grabs to make the placement of Chauvin’s hand more visible. The enhanced version of the photo shows Chauvin’s knuckles resting against his thigh, with his fingers bent backwards.
Matthew Stamm, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Drexel University, is an expert on falsified images and videos. Stamm said USA Today’s techniques for enhancing the screen grab images were a legitimate way to visually interpret what they showed.
Stamm and researcher Brian Hosler also reviewed Frazier’s video for PolitiFact. From screen grabs that they took, they concluded that Chauvin’s hand was on his thigh, not in his pocket.
Several use-of-force experts and law enforcement personnel, including Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, said Floyd had stopped resisting before his breathing came to a halt.
""Once Mr. Floyd had stopped resisting — and certainly once he was in distress and trying to verbalize that — that should have stopped,"" Arradondo said of Chauvin’s use of force.
",PolitiFact,"
Facebook posts said Chauvin had his left hand in his pocket while kneeling on George Floyd.
While some screen grabs taken from a bystander’s video appear to show that Chauvin had his left hand in his pocket as he pressed Floyd to the pavement, both the video itself and enhanced versions of the screen grabs indicate that his hand was actually on his thigh. 
Chauvin was wearing black gloves during the incident that blended in with his dark pants.
We rate this Facebook post False.

Greg Abbott: George Soros of New York pouring money into Texas to elect Democratic 'puppets' in fall
</h2>
</header>
<div adbridg-ad-class=""mobileinterstitial""></div>
<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>In 2017, <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/texas/article/2017/sep/11/greg-abbott-warns-george-soros-who-hasnt-spent-dim/"">we found no evidence</a> of George Soros, the internationally prominent pro-Democratic financier, investing in races for state office in Texas.</p>
<p>More recently, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott warned afresh about Soros in a fundraising letter, opening: ""Every weapon in the national Democrat machine’s arsenal is aimed straight at Texas today.""</p>
<p>Abbott’s April 2, 2018, letter states next: ""Left-wing BILLIONAIRE George Soros has already unloaded a whopping $1 million to install his liberal puppets in positions of power this fall.""</p>
<p>The letter warns that Democrats are preparing an all-out assault and could seize control of the state at the ballot box. ""I know,"" the letter further says, that ""left-wing special interests and BILLIONAIRE liberals like George Soros are pouring outrageous sums of money into driving up Democrat turnout.""</p>
<p>After we didn’t hear back from Abbott about his basis for the ""puppets"" claim, we decided to check state, local and federal records for indications of Soros unpacking lucre to help Texas Democrats win election in 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Soros helped a Bexar County Democrat</strong></p>
<p>From the top, we knew that Soros invested significantly in a group that backed a successful challenger to the Bexar County district attorney. Attorney <a href=""https://www.gonzales4da.com/"">Joe Gonzales</a> <a href=""https://www.expressnews.com/news/politics/texas_legislature/article/LaHood-out-as-Bexar-County-district-attorney-12733741.php"">bested</a> first-term incumbent <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Lahood.Nico/"">Nicholas ""Nico"" LaHood</a> in Bexar County’s Democratic primary after Soros contributions propelled a pro-Gonzales political committee.</p>
<p>Of note: Soros boosted the pro-Gonzales committee a couple of years after Soros put more than $1.4 million into electing Democrat Kim Ogg as the district attorney of Harris County. An October 2016 <em>Houston Chronicle </em><a href=""http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/houston/article/Soros-again-pumps-money-into-Harris-County-9970308.php"">news story </a>pointed out that Soros had similarly put his money into district attorney races in Florida, Illinois, Mississippi and New Mexico, each time through state-specific PACs with variations on the name ""Safety and Justice."" The story also said Soros had supported criminal justice reforms including reduced racial disparities in sentencing and relaxed marijuana restrictions.</p>
<p>In San Antonio, LaHood chalked up his loss to Soros’s spending, the <em>San Antonio Express-News</em> reported. ""In my opinion, the voters were unfairly influenced by $1 million worth of lies,"" LaHood said. ""There's no other way to say it.""</p>
<p>Gonzales has yet to win the DA post; he’s set to face Republican <a href=""http://tyldenshaefferforda.com/"">Tylden Shaeffer</a> on this November's ballot.</p>
<p>For his part, Gonzales <a href=""https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/politics/article/Gonzales-ready-for-next-matchup-with-Shaeffer-12736851.php"">said</a> after his primary win that Soros’ contributions came without strings attached. ""There was a clear understanding from the beginning that we would accept their contributions, but we were not going to be told how to run this office,"" Gonzales said.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>An <em>Express-News</em> <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JxZlc4TgJMExQ5cfZKXzTM5y-tOpP5Ujk0T-j1q78T0/edit#gid=0"">spreadsheet</a> tallies contributions by Soros to Texas Justice &amp; Public Safety, the political committee supportive of Gonzales. According to the sheet, which was based on Gonzales’ campaign finance reports filed with the county elections department on Jan. 17, Feb. 5 and Feb. 26, 2018, the committee made $964,377 worth of in-kind contributions to Gonzales’ campaign from Dec. 18, 2017, through Feb. 23, 2018, mostly in TV ads and voter mailings but also in polling, research and palm cards.</p>
<p>Gonzales’ campaign directly fielded no Soros contributions, the filings indicate.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Democratic beneficiaries?</strong></p>
<p>Abbott’s fundraising letter warns of Soros spending money to install ""puppets.""</p>
<p>To gauge whether Soros chose multiple Texas Democrats to help, we conducted online searches of candidate and political committee finance reports filed with  the Texas Ethics Commission and Federal Election Commission.</p>
<p>Previously, <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Phso-5xQ-6Hbdd73BbXgZFVRGOBL8zRMQ76sGQVSzyU/edit?usp=sharing"">our 2017 search of campaign finance reports</a> filed with the ethics commission from 2000 into 2017 indicated Soros hadn’t personally donated to candidates for state office--not once. Similarly, our fresh search of state records yielded no indication of Soros spending on races besides the Bexar County battle for the Democratic nomination for district attorney. In pre-primary reports, we found, the pro-Gonzales Texas Justice &amp; Public Safety committee reported fielding $1.04 million in Soros contributions.</p>
<p>According to our separate search of campaign reports filed with the FEC, <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xF4usPogfcy87_gT4hetmROiAbR40XwJrn_XJRSAbDE/edit?usp=sharing"">Soros made 49 contributions</a> nationally from February 2017 into March 2018, totaling $4,587,000.</p>
<p>But, our search suggests, very little went to Texas Democrats. We identified a single Soros contribution to a Texas candidate. Soros gave<a href=""http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?201802020200108218""> $2,700 on Dec. 1, 2017</a> to Democratic U.S. Senate hopeful Beto O’Rourke, the El Paso congressman.</p>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>Abbott warned in his letter that Soros has spent $1 million to ""install his liberal puppets in positions of power"" in Texas this fall.</p>
<p>We confirmed Soros spending in Texas, but he's yet to put a penny toward Democrats seeking state office. The New Yorker gave a little more than $1 million to a committee that helped a challenger win the Democratic nod for Bexar County district attorney. He gave $2,700 to O’Rourke, who went on to win the Democratic Senate nomination.</p>
<p>All told, we rate this claim Half True.</p>

More recently, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott warned afresh about Soros in a fundraising letter, opening: ""Every weapon in the national Democrat machine’s arsenal is aimed straight at Texas today.""
Abbott’s April 2, 2018, letter states next: ""Left-wing BILLIONAIRE George Soros has already unloaded a whopping $1 million to install his liberal puppets in positions of power this fall.""
The letter warns that Democrats are preparing an all-out assault and could seize control of the state at the ballot box. ""I know,"" the letter further says, that ""left-wing special interests and BILLIONAIRE liberals like George Soros are pouring outrageous sums of money into driving up Democrat turnout.""
After we didn’t hear back from Abbott about his basis for the ""puppets"" claim, we decided to check state, local and federal records for indications of Soros unpacking lucre to help Texas Democrats win election in 2018.
Soros helped a Bexar County Democrat
From the top, we knew that Soros invested significantly in a group that backed a successful challenger to the Bexar County district attorney. Attorney Joe Gonzales bested first-term incumbent Nicholas ""Nico"" LaHood in Bexar County’s Democratic primary after Soros contributions propelled a pro-Gonzales political committee.
Of note: Soros boosted the pro-Gonzales committee a couple of years after Soros put more than $1.4 million into electing Democrat Kim Ogg as the district attorney of Harris County. An October 2016 Houston Chronicle news story pointed out that Soros had similarly put his money into district attorney races in Florida, Illinois, Mississippi and New Mexico, each time through state-specific PACs with variations on the name ""Safety and Justice."" The story also said Soros had supported criminal justice reforms including reduced racial disparities in sentencing and relaxed marijuana restrictions.
In San Antonio, LaHood chalked up his loss to Soros’s spending, the San Antonio Express-News reported. ""In my opinion, the voters were unfairly influenced by $1 million worth of lies,"" LaHood said. ""There's no other way to say it.""
Gonzales has yet to win the DA post; he’s set to face Republican Tylden Shaeffer on this November's ballot.
For his part, Gonzales said after his primary win that Soros’ contributions came without strings attached. ""There was a clear understanding from the beginning that we would accept their contributions, but we were not going to be told how to run this office,"" Gonzales said.

Former President Barack Obama was arrested after his campaign “took $30 million illegally from Commie China fugitive.”












By Loreben Tuquero • May 3, 2023







An Express-News spreadsheet tallies contributions by Soros to Texas Justice &amp; Public Safety, the political committee supportive of Gonzales. According to the sheet, which was based on Gonzales’ campaign finance reports filed with the county elections department on Jan. 17, Feb. 5 and Feb. 26, 2018, the committee made $964,377 worth of in-kind contributions to Gonzales’ campaign from Dec. 18, 2017, through Feb. 23, 2018, mostly in TV ads and voter mailings but also in polling, research and palm cards.
Gonzales’ campaign directly fielded no Soros contributions, the filings indicate.
Multiple Democratic beneficiaries?
Abbott’s fundraising letter warns of Soros spending money to install ""puppets.""
To gauge whether Soros chose multiple Texas Democrats to help, we conducted online searches of candidate and political committee finance reports filed with  the Texas Ethics Commission and Federal Election Commission.
Previously, our 2017 search of campaign finance reports filed with the ethics commission from 2000 into 2017 indicated Soros hadn’t personally donated to candidates for state office--not once. Similarly, our fresh search of state records yielded no indication of Soros spending on races besides the Bexar County battle for the Democratic nomination for district attorney. In pre-primary reports, we found, the pro-Gonzales Texas Justice &amp; Public Safety committee reported fielding $1.04 million in Soros contributions.
According to our separate search of campaign reports filed with the FEC, Soros made 49 contributions nationally from February 2017 into March 2018, totaling $4,587,000.
But, our search suggests, very little went to Texas Democrats. We identified a single Soros contribution to a Texas candidate. Soros gave $2,700 on Dec. 1, 2017 to Democratic U.S. Senate hopeful Beto O’Rourke, the El Paso congressman.
<strong",PolitiFact,"
Abbott warned in his letter that Soros has spent $1 million to ""install his liberal puppets in positions of power"" in Texas this fall.
We confirmed Soros spending in Texas, but he's yet to put a penny toward Democrats seeking state office. The New Yorker gave a little more than $1 million to a committee that helped a challenger win the Democratic nod for Bexar County district attorney. He gave $2,700 to O’Rourke, who went on to win the Democratic Senate nomination.

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>As he lauded his first month in office, President Donald Trump reaffirmed his promise to create jobs by citing the progress of the stock market as signaling a promising business environment.</p>
<p>""The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world,"" Trump said in a press conference Feb. 16. ""To me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, ‘Oh, that's good.’ Now it means, ‘That's good for jobs.’ Very different.""</p>
<p>Trump had sent a similar message earlier in the day, <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/832191485701451777"">tweeting</a>: ""Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades. Great level of confidence and optimism - even before tax plan rollout!""</p>

<script async="""" charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script></div>
<p>All three major stock indexes closed at record highs for five days in row on Feb. 15. But does Trump get credit for that, as he suggested? Experts told us there are nuances.</p>
<p><strong>Stock market winning streaks</strong></p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average includes the stocks of the <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/data/dow30/"">30</a> largest and most powerful companies in the country (Wal-Mart, Disney, Pfizer, for example). The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 (S&amp;P 500) consists of the <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/102501.asp"">500 most commonly traded stocks</a> and represents about 80 percent of the total value of U.S. stock markets. The Nasdaq Composite Index features mostly technology companies.</p>
<p>All three major indexes <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/15/investing/stock-market-record-trump/"">on Feb. 15</a> closed at record highs for the fifth consecutive day.</p>
<p>It was the first time the three indexes achieved concurrent high records for that length of time since January 1992, according to analyses reported by <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/15/investing/stock-market-record-trump/"">CNNMoney</a> and <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stock-futures-point-to-pause-for-record-setting-rally-yellen-data-on-tap-2017-02-15"">MarketWatch</a>.</p>
<p>MarketWatch <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-flubs-factoid-as-he-touts-stock-markets-longest-winning-streak-in-decades-2017-02-16"">countered</a> part of Trump’s tweet, saying that the Feb. 15 high really wasn’t ""the longest winning streak in decades.""</p>
<p>""Rather, it’s the best record-setting stretch in a quarter century … In terms of winning streaks, the S&amp;P has risen for seven consecutive trading days for its longest stretch of up days since September 2013, when it also rose for seven straight sessions. That’s according to Dow Jones data,"" <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-flubs-factoid-as-he-touts-stock-markets-longest-winning-streak-in-decades-2017-02-16"">wrote</a> MarketWatch’s Victor Reklaitis, also noting Dow gains for five days straight and a Nasdaq seven-session winning streak. (More on the those winning streaks <a href=""http://www.nasdaq.com/article/us-stocks-snapshotsp-mints-7th-straight-up-day-helped-by-robust-data-20170215-01250"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.nasdaq.com/article/us-stockswall-street-rises-further-into-uncharted-territory-20170215-01165"">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Experts told us that investors are at least somewhat hopeful about Trump’s promised tax and regulation cuts, though that’s not the sole driver of the stock market highs.</p>
<p>Trump signed an <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1353/slash-federal-regulations/"">executive order</a> on Jan. 30 directing that for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be eliminated. Trump says ""<a href=""https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/regulations"">wasteful and unnecessary</a>"" regulation kills jobs and <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-regulations-idUSKCN12629R"">stop businesses from growing</a>.</p>
<p>Trump also <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/subjects/taxes/"">has promised</a> to slash the business <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1425/lower-business-tax-rate/"">tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent</a> and to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>In <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/23/trump-pledges-major-border-tax-ceo-meeting-white-house/96949832/"">meetings with CEOs </a>of different industries, Trump has reiterated that tax cuts are coming and that he’d like to <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2017/01/24/511341779/president-trump-to-cut-regulations-by-75-percent-how-real-is-that"">get rid of 75 percent of regulations</a>, ""maybe more."" He has also tweeted about a <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/04/donald-trump/mostly-true-trump-tweet-about-gm-chevy-cruze-manuf/"">border tax</a> for imports.</p>
<p>""I would definitely say Trump gets credit,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The S&amp;P 500 returns are up 3.8 percent from Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, said Stovall, who has studied the market’s returns during each president’s first month dating back to President Herbert Hoover in 1929.</p>
<p>Amid the recession and during Obama's first month in office in 2009, returns fell 9.4 percent, Stovall said. They rose 1.4 percent during Obama's first month in office in his second term, according to Stovall's study.</p>
<p>Tim Duy, an economist and professor at the University of Oregon, said the economy was poised for relative strength as the end of 2016 approached, regardless of Trump’s inauguration.</p>
<p>""Underlying growth remained solid, and it increasingly looked like some of the inventory overhang of the previous year was easing,"" Duy said. Manufacturing and services sector surveys were going up, and two factors that’d been weighing on stocks -- decline in oil prices and strength of the dollar -- waned over 2016, Duy added.</p>
<p>""The economy was not headed into a recession and, in the absence of a recession, stocks are more likely to go up than down,"" Duy said. ""In other words, this was largely baked into the cake regardless of who won the election. Trump was handed a solid economy at the macro level.""</p>
<p>It’s still reasonable to believe that hopes of tax cuts have boosted stocks to some degree, but it wasn’t the dominant factor, Duy said.</p>
<p>Economic news has been nuanced in recent weeks.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm"">Data</a> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show 227,000 jobs were added in January 2017. The unemployment rate in January was 4.8 percent, slightly higher than the previous month but based on 584,000 more people looking for jobs after accounting for annual adjustments to population controls, according to Feb. 3 BLS figures.</p>
<p>""Consumer confidence decreased in January, after reaching a 15-year high in December,"" said in a<a href=""https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm""> Jan. 31 statement</a> Lynn Franco, director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, which presents the Consumer Confidence Index based on a monthly survey.</p>
<p>""The decline in confidence was driven solely by a less optimistic outlook for business conditions, jobs, and especially consumers’ income prospects. Consumers’ assessment of current conditions, on the other hand, improved in January,"" Franco said. ""Despite the retreat in confidence, consumers remain confident that the economy will continue to expand in the coming months.""</p>
<p>Trump certainly isn’t the first to boast about the stock market’s performance.</p>
<p>In 2015, Hillary Clinton claimed the stock market does better when there’s a Democratic president. While several calculations backed her statement, we rated her claim <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/04/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-stock-market-has-done-better-/"">Mostly True</a> because experts said several other factors are key in determining performance, including timing, policies and international economic trends.</p>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>Trump said, ""The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world.""</p>
<p>The three major stock indexes, Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all closed at record highs for five consecutive days. While investors are optimistic about Trump’s plans to cut taxes and eliminate regulations, experts say other factors play influential roles in the stock market. After rising in December, consumer confidence dropped in January, though consumers are confident the economy will expand in coming months.</p>
<p>Trump’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.</p><a href=""https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1d390b70-d630-4f46-b741-dc15ff7f33e7"">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1d390b70-d630-4f46-b741-dc15ff7f33e7</a>

</div>]","As he lauded his first month in office, President Donald Trump reaffirmed his promise to create jobs by citing the progress of the stock market as signaling a promising business environment.
""The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world,"" Trump said in a press conference Feb. 16. ""To me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, ‘Oh, that's good.’ Now it means, ‘That's good for jobs.’ Very different.""
Trump had sent a similar message earlier in the day, tweeting: ""Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades. Great level of confidence and optimism - even before tax plan rollout!""
Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades. Great level of confidence and optimism - even before tax plan rollout!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 16, 2017

All three major stock indexes closed at record highs for five days in row on Feb. 15. But does Trump get credit for that, as he suggested? Experts told us there are nuances.
Stock market winning streaks
The Dow Jones Industrial Average includes the stocks of the 30 largest and most powerful companies in the country (Wal-Mart, Disney, Pfizer, for example). The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 (S&amp;P 500) consists of the 500 most commonly traded stocks and represents about 80 percent of the total value of U.S. stock markets. The Nasdaq Composite Index features mostly technology companies.
All three major indexes on Feb. 15 closed at record highs for the fifth consecutive day.
It was the first time the three indexes achieved concurrent high records for that length of time since January 1992, according to analyses reported by CNNMoney and MarketWatch.
MarketWatch countered part of Trump’s tweet, saying that the Feb. 15 high really wasn’t ""the longest winning streak in decades.""
""Rather, it’s the best record-setting stretch in a quarter century … In terms of winning streaks, the S&amp;P has risen for seven consecutive trading days for its longest stretch of up days since September 2013, when it also rose for seven straight sessions. That’s according to Dow Jones data,"" wrote MarketWatch’s Victor Reklaitis, also noting Dow gains for five days straight and a Nasdaq seven-session winning streak. (More on the those winning streaks here and here.)
Experts told us that investors are at least somewhat hopeful about Trump’s promised tax and regulation cuts, though that’s not the sole driver of the stock market highs.
Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 30 directing that for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be eliminated. Trump says ""wasteful and unnecessary"" regulation kills jobs and stop businesses from growing.
Trump also has promised to slash the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax.

In meetings with CEOs of different industries, Trump has reiterated that tax cuts are coming and that he’d like to get rid of 75 percent of regulations, ""maybe more."" He has also tweeted about a border tax for imports.
""I would definitely say Trump gets credit,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The S&amp;P 500 returns are up 3.8 percent from Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, said Stovall, who has studied the market’s returns during each president’s first month dating back to President Herbert Hoover in 1929.
Amid the recession and during Obama's first month in office in 2009, returns fell 9.4 percent, Stovall said. They rose 1.4 percent during Obama's first month in office in his second term, according to Stovall's study.
Tim Duy, an economist and professor at the University of Oregon, said the economy was poised for relative strength as the end of 2016 approached, regardless of Trump’s inauguration.
""Underlying growth remained solid, and it increasingly looked like some of the inventory overhang of the previous year was easing,"" Duy said. Manufacturing and services sector surveys were going up, and two factors that’d been weighing on stocks -- decline in oil prices and strength of the dollar -- waned over 2016, Duy added.
""The economy was not headed into a recession and, in the absence of a recession, stocks are more likely to go up than down,"" Duy said. ""In other words, this was largely baked into the cake regardless of who won the election. Trump was handed a solid economy at the macro level.""
It’s still reasonable to believe that hopes of tax cuts have boosted stocks to some degree, but it wasn’t the dominant factor, Duy said.
Economic news has been nuanced in recent weeks.
Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show 227,000 jobs were added in January 2017. The unemployment rate in January was 4.8 percent, slightly higher than the previous month but based on 584,000 more people looking for jobs after accounting for annual adjustments to population controls, according to Feb. 3 BLS figures.
""Consumer confidence decreased in January, after reaching a 15-year high in December,"" said in a Jan. 31 statement Lynn Franco, director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, which presents the Consumer Confidence Index based on a monthly survey.
""The decline in confidence was driven solely by a less optimistic outlook for business conditions, jobs, and especially consumers’ income prospects. Consumers’ assessment of current conditions, on the other hand, improved in January,"" Franco said. ""Despite the retreat in confidence, consumers remain confident that the economy will continue to expand in the coming months.""
Trump certainly isn’t the first to boast about the stock market’s performance.
In 2015, Hillary Clinton claimed the stock market does better when there’s a Democratic president. While several calculations backed her statement, we rated her claim Mostly True because experts said several other factors are key in determining performance, including timing, policies and international economic trends.
<strong",PolitiFact,"
Trump said, ""The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world.""
The three major stock indexes, Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all closed at record highs for five consecutive days. While investors are optimistic about Trump’s plans to cut taxes and eliminate regulations, experts say other factors play influential roles in the stock market. After rising in December, consumer confidence dropped in January, though consumers are confident the economy will expand in coming months.
Trump’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1d390b70-d630-4f46-b741-dc15ff7f33e7

<p>President Donald Trump’s first <a href=""https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-town-hall-fox-news-baier-maccallum-march-5-2020"">town hall</a> of 2020 was in Scranton, Pa. — birthplace of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and a state that was key to Trump’s 2016 victory.</p>
<p>Trump directed much of his criticism at Biden at the Fox News event, poking fun at his gaffes and rehashing the fact that his son Hunter Biden served on the board of an energy company in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Trump said he had been ""all set"" to take on Sen. Bernie Sanders, whom he falsely called a ""communist,"" but that the matchup was looking less likely. Fox News will host a <a href=""http://press.foxnews.com/2020/03/fox-news-channel-to-present-a-town-hall-with-2020-democratic-presidential-candidate-senator-bernie-sanders-on-monday-march-9th/"">town hall with Sanders on March 9 in Detroit, Mich.</a></p>
<p>The town hall included some critical questions by audience members. One undecided voter told Trump at the ""outset of the coronavirus, your administration’s response seemed to some as being confusing or minimizing."" Another asked Trump if his message could be delivered without ""controversial rhetoric.""</p>
<p>Trump presented himself as a leader who inherited a heap of problems from Barack Obama and delivered on his campaign promises anyway. We fact-checked several of his misleading or inaccurate claims.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline""><strong>Coronavirus</strong></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Says the administration has been ""given tremendous marks"" for its coronavirus response. ""You look at Gallup poll, you look at other polls, for the way we have handled it.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is misleading. The Gallup poll is from the first half of February, before any American died within the United States, and before major news reports about <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/04/lou-dobbs/lou-dobbs-says-united-states-screening-fewer-peopl/"">flaws in early CDC test kits</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://news.gallup.com/poll/286277/high-confidence-government-handle-coronavirus.aspx"">Gallup poll</a> conducted Feb. 3-16 found that three in four Americans said they were very confident (31%) or somewhat confident (46%) in the federal government's ability to handle an outbreak of the coronavirus. The poll included a random sample of 1,028 adults and a margin of error of 4 percentage points.</p>
<p>The poll started days after the Trump administration announced it would suspend entry of foreign nationals into the U.S. among those who had traveled to China in the prior two weeks. The poll took place before any deaths within the U.S., although one American died in China in the middle of the polling period. According to the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html"">CDC</a> as of March 5, there were a total of 99 cases in the U.S., 10 deaths and cases in 13 states.</p>
<p>A more recent poll, done by <a href=""https://morningconsult.com/2020/03/02/coronavirus-trump-approval-decline-poll/"">MorningConsult,</a> shows that approval of Trump’s response has been dropping. The Feb. 28-March 1 <a href=""https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/200271_crosstabs_CORONAVIRUS_RVs_v2_JB.pdf"">survey</a> showed that 49% of voters approved of Trump’s response to the outbreak, down from 56% in a Feb. 24-26 <a href=""https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/200260_crosstabs_CORONAVIRUS_RVs_v2_JB.pdf"">survey</a> — a decline fueled by drops among independents and Democrats.</p>
<p>The new Morning Consult poll surveyed 1,997 registered voters and carries a margin of error of two percentage points.</p>
<p>There is some good news for the federal government in the most recent poll: a majority of voters approve of the CDC’s handling the spread of coronavirus, Trump declaring a public health emergency and seeking emergency funding, and appointing Pence to coordinate U.S. efforts</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Says Hunter Biden ""didn't have a job, was unfortunately, sadly, the military was a very sad experience for him. He goes out, he gets $3 million plus $183,000 a month to be a board member of a company that a lot of people said was corrupt.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump misleads when he portrays Hunter Biden as unemployed when he <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5980032-Burisma-Announces-Hunter-Biden-s-Appointment-to.html"">joined the board</a> of a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, in 2014. At the time, Hunter Biden was a counsel to Boies, Schiller and Flexner, a national law firm based in New York, according to a <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5980032-Burisma-Announces-Hunter-Biden-s-Appointment-to.html"">statement</a> from Burisma. He was also chairman of the board of Rosemont Seneca Advisors and an adjunct professor at <a href=""http://energysecurityforum.org/speakers2016/46-hunter-biden"">Georgetown University’s</a> master’s program in the school of foreign service.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden was<a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/17/hunter-biden-drug-test/17427857/""> discharged from the Navy Reserve in 2014</a> following a failed drug test for cocaine.</p>
<p>The details of how much Hunter Biden was paid by Burisma have been part of the <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/dec/16/silence-year-what-did-hunter-biden-do-burisma/"">mystery</a> surrounding what he did on the board. Experts have said that Hunter’s position on the board presented a<a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/may/07/viral-image/fact-checking-joe-biden-hunter-biden-and-ukraine/""> serious conflict of interest for his father</a> when he was vice president and engaging in Ukraine. However, there has been no finding of wrongdoing by his father and no charge of specific wrongdoing against Hunter Biden.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hunter Biden ""walks out of China with a $1.5 billion for a fund.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lacks evidence. We have looked at <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/oct/02/donald-trumps-accusations-about-hunter-biden-and-c/"">Hunter Biden’s business dealings in China</a> and found no evidence that he actually obtained $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/bohai-harvest-and-u-s-investment-firms-expand-target-for-outbound-fund-1404956572"">Wall Street Journal article</a> in July 2014 reported that Hunter Biden’s firm was ""aiming to raise about $1.5 billion."" This means that, a full six months after Hunter Biden left China, the $1.5 billion figure was aspirational, not confirmed. This undermines Trump’s version of events, which is that Biden quickly pocketed $1.5 billion after a meeting while the elder Biden was vice president.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""So mentally I'm all set for Bernie — communist, I had everything down.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/04/scott-walker/no-bernie-sanders-not-communist/"">False</a>. Sanders is not a communist.</p>
<p>Experts said there are clear differences between Sanders’ democratic socialism — which focuses on democratically achieved expansion of social welfare programs — and any commonly accepted definition of communism. Sanders isn’t pushing for authoritarian rule, government ownership of all private property or an end to capitalism. Instead, he wants ""Medicare for All"" and free access to public colleges and universities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Says Joe Biden ""said 150 million people were killed with guns.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is correct. Biden’s campaign said he <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/feb/26/free-all-fact-checking-south-carolina-democratic-p/"">misspoke during the South Carolina debate</a>.</p>
<p>Biden meant to say 150,000, the number of firearm homicides. That number checks out with the CDC data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking of illegal immigration, ""And we have the best numbers that we’ve had in many, many months. ... I guess it's now nine or 10 months where the numbers are way down.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is true that apprehensions at the southwest border are down compared with May 2019, as Trump’s re-election campaign pointed out. However, May apprehensions were the highest month in fiscal year 2019.</p>
<p>There were <a href=""https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration/fy-2019"">132,856</a> apprehensions in May 2019 compared with <a href=""https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration"">30,068</a> in February 2020.</p>
<p>Apprehensions have generally been decreasing since May (though there were 862 more apprehensions in February than in January). An immigration expert told PolitiFact that at least two factors had likely influenced a decline in border apprehensions: the U.S. implementation of the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, known as <a href=""https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/01/24/migrant-protection-protocols"">Migrant Protection Protocols</a>, and Mexico's increased enforcement actions at its own southern border.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""The wall is way under construction, we're up to 129 miles already. ... We will have by early next year almost 500 miles of wall.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nearly all of the construction at the southwest border has been to replace existing barriers, not to create a wall that wasn’t there before.</p>
<p>The nearly 2,000-mile southwest border had <a href=""https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/682838.pdf"">654 miles</a> of primary barriers before Trump was elected. Three years into Trump’s presidency, that has increased by 1 mile, to 655.</p>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection told PolitiFact that as of Feb. 28, the Trump administration had worked on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A total 131<strong> </strong>miles of primary and secondary barriers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primary barriers: 119 miles involve replacements, 1 mile where none existed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary barriers: 10 miles involve replacements, 1 mile where none existed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether the administration can complete around 400 more miles in one year is uncertain. CBP awarded a series of construction contracts in 2019 and February, but the agency did not provide expected completion dates for all projects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""Pre-existing conditions, 100%, we take care of.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump’s assurances about maintaining coverage for pre-existing conditions have previously rated <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jan/15/donald-trump/trumps-claim-he-saved-pre-ex-conditions-part-fanta/"">Pants on Fire</a>.</p>
<p>As president, his administration has sought in court to repeal Obamacare without offering any replacement that might maintain its core protections. That includes protections for pre-existing conditions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""We have many health care plans now, where it's 60%, even 65% less expensive than Obamacare. It's better than Obamacare.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a repeated <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/10/donald-trump/better-other-plans-or-better-nothing-trumps-claim-/"">Mostly False</a> claim.</p>
<p>The short-term, limited-duration plans he’s talking about are not new. They have been around for decades in various forms and are generally considered a stopgap solution for people between jobs or attending school. These plans offer fewer benefits than what’s covered in plans under Obamacare and can bar people with health conditions from enrolling.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to make an apples-to-apples price comparison between the short-term plans and Obamacare plans since they don’t have the same coverage or protections. Health policy experts say that the coverage short-term plans provide is not better than that of Obamacare plans.</p>

<p>The Cameron LNG project has three plants that chill down natural gas until it becomes a liquid to be shipped worldwide.</p>
<p>According to the <a href=""https://cameronlng.com/lng-import-export/timeline/"">company website</a>, in 2014 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued the final environmental impact statement to construct and operate the liquefaction facility. The company got its first federal approval <a href=""https://fossil.energy.gov/ng_regulation/sites/default/files/programs/gasregulation/authorizations/2012/orders/ord3059.pdf"">in 2012</a>. In 2016, Washington gave permission to add another two liquefaction lines, although the company hasn’t decided to move ahead on those.</p>

But I will tell you, I don't think they admit that. Maybe they do, but called many times. And Kim Jong Un did not want to talk to him.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We previously rated Trump’s story of Kim Jong Un rejecting calls from the Obama administration as <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/jul/01/donald-trump/trump-wrong-obama-begged-meet-north-koreas-kim-jon/"">False</a> for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>The public record shows the Obama administration rejected the idea of meetings of any sort until North Korea promised to back off of its nuclear program and accept international inspections.</p>
<p>While the administration held out hope of North Korea meeting those preconditions during Obama’s first term, in the second, it took a harder line. There is no evidence that Obama begged for a meeting.</p>
<p>Susan Rice, a former Obama security advisor, <a href=""https://twitter.com/ambassadorrice/status/1186380074762850310?lang=en"">tweeted</a> in 2019 that Trump’s statement about Obama trying to call Kim Jong Un was a ""total fabrication.""</p>

<p>That means that African-American women earned 67 cents for every dollar a man made, while Hispanic women earned 55 cents.</p>
<p>The data for Native American women was harder to locate. The National Partnership of Women and Families pointed us to a <a href=""https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk"">different data set</a> from <a href=""https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_1YR_B20017C&amp;prodType=table"">the Census Bureau</a>.</p>
<p>According to that data set, men earned a median of $39,819, while Native American women earned $23,214. That works out to 58 cents on the dollar, as the tweet said.</p>
<p>All told, the tweet’s figure for African Americans was off by four cents, the figure for Hispanics was off by one cent, and the figure was accurate for Native Americans.</p>
<p>So, two of the tweet’s figures are off the mark, but not by much.</p>
<p>A final note: as we’ve <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/mar/14/patricia-farley/taking-closer-look-florida-democrats-claims-about-/"">written</a> previously, this figure refers to the general disparity between what men and women earn, and does not compare cases of apples to apples.</p>
<p>These comparisons do not adjust for such factors as the degrees and jobs women pursue, the time they take off to care for children, or the years of experience they’ve had.</p>

Is this correct? After looking at the underlying data, we found that it’s not far off.
When we contacted the party, they pointed us to a report produced by the National Partnership of Women and Families in April 2019.
The report said that ""among women who hold full-time, year-round jobs in the United States, Black women are typically paid 61 cents, Native American women 58 cents and Latinas just 53 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men.""
Those aren’t exactly the same numbers that the party offered, but they match the previous year’s version of the partnership’s report. So the data is slightly out of date.

<p>The White House didn’t replace either White House official or his team. Instead, Trump looked within his administration to fill roles for the coronavirus response. </p>
<p>In January, Trump appointed his Health and Human Services secretary, Alex Azar, to chair a coronavirus task force. On Feb. 26, he announced that Vice President Mike Pence would take charge of the U.S. response to the coronavirus. </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Trump ""refused WHO tests""</div>
<p>This contains a hint of truth, but it’s mostly inaccurate. Former Vice President Joe Biden <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/16/joe-biden/biden-falsely-says-trump-administration-rejected-w/"">made a similar claim</a> during the March 15 Democratic presidential debate.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/06/coronavirus-testing-failure-123166"">A March 6 Politico article</a> says the World Health Organization shipped coronavirus tests to nearly 60 countries at the end of February, but the U.S. was not among them. That is correct, but it suggests that the U.S. would normally have been on the list, which is not the case.</p>
<p>""No discussions occurred between WHO and CDC about WHO providing COVID-19 tests to the United States,"" said WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris. ""This is consistent with experience since the United States does not ordinarily rely on WHO for reagents or diagnostic tests because of sufficient domestic capacity.""</p>
<p><strong><em>RELATED:</em> <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/mar/12/fact-checking-donald-trumps-mistakes-about-europea/"">Fact-checking Donald Trump’s mistakes about European travel due to coronavirus</a></strong></p>
<p>Instead, the U.S. decided to have the CDC develop its own testing protocol, which was published Jan. 28. This caused a lag in testing for the virus in the U.S.</p>
<p>The CDC’s test was different and more complicated than a test published in Germany on Jan. 17. It worked in the CDC lab, but <a href=""https://www.propublica.org/article/cdc-coronavirus-covid-19-test"">when the materials went out to state labs</a>, some of them got inconsistent results. The CDC had to resend packages with new chemical reagents.</p>
<p><a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762951"">State laboratories</a> started developing their own tests and were ready to use them, but had to wait for emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration. The combined delays resulted in fewer Americans being tested and a slower U.S. response overall compared with some other countries. </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Trump ""wasted two weeks calling this outbreak a ‘Democrat hoax.’""</div>
<p>This is inaccurate. </p>
<p>During <a href=""https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-charleston-south-carolina-rally-transcript-february-28-2020"">a Feb. 28 campaign rally</a> in North Charleston, S.C., Trump called the Democratic response to COVID-19 a ""hoax."" But he did not use the term to describe the virus itself.</p>
<p>During a press conference Feb. 29, Trump was asked about his remarks.</p>
<p>""I'm not talking about what's happening here; I'm talking what they're doing,"" he said, referring to Democrats. ""That's the hoax.""</p>
<p>Trump’s comments feed into <a href=""https://youtu.be/fUNrXN9XC2k?t=4440"">a conspiracy theory</a> that claims Democrats and the media are fabricating the threat of COVID-19 to hurt the economy and the president’s re-election chances. And the president appeared <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-cdc.html"">to</a> <a href=""https://apnews.com/896611803373610849fe8602b64e181e"">downplay</a> the threat of the virus at several points in recent weeks.</p>
<p>But to say that Trump called the virus itself a hoax <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/15/joe-biden/ad-watch-biden-video-twists-trumps-words-coronavir/"">is false</a>. Plus, the administration took its first action in January by setting up a task force to address the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>An Instagram post made four claims that criticize Trump’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The first, that he ""cut funding to the CDC,"" is partially accurate; Trump tried to cut the agency’s funding, but Congress prevented it from happening. On the second claim, while saying Trump ""fired"" the ""Pandemic Response Team"" is a stretch, it’s true that National Security Council staffers left abruptly in 2018 and were not replaced. </p>
<p>The third claim, that Trump ""refused WHO tests,"" contains a hint of truth, but is mostly inaccurate since the U.S. does not usually rely on the WHO for testing protocols. And the fourth claim, which says Trump ""wasted two weeks calling this outbreak a ‘Democrat hoax,’"" is inaccurate — the president has not called the virus itself a ""hoax,"" just the Democrats’ response to it.</p>
<p>As a whole, the Instagram post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.</p>

</div>]","Democrats have criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic as disorganized and short-sighted. On Instagram, the critics include some celebrities.
On March 15, actor and comedian D.L. Hughley posted a screenshot of a tweet that makes several claims about the Trump administration’s actions against coronavirus.
""Dear President Trump,"" reads the tweet, which was published March 13 by an account called Translate Trump. ""YOU cut funding to the CDC; YOU fired the Pandemic Response Team; YOU refused WHO tests; YOU wasted 2 weeks calling this outbreak a ‘Democrat hoax.’""
""This is a (sic) what a failed public response to a pandemic looks like.""
This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It had more than 42,000 likes as of March 17.

(Screenshot from Instagram)
In the United States, the coronavirus had infected 4,226 people in 49 states, with 94 deaths, as of March 17. On March 11, Trump announced several sweeping actions to slow the spread of the virus, including a ban on travel from a slate of European countries.
Some public health experts have said the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic has been too slow, but are the four claims shown in Hughley’s Instagram post accurate? We looked at each one.
The Instagram post has elements of truth but leaves out a lot of important information. We reached out to Translate Trump and the White House for comments, but we haven’t heard back.
Trump ""cut funding to the CDC""
While it’s not accurate to say that Trump ""cut"" funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is accurate to say he tried.
The Trump administration’s initial proposals for the budgets for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases at the CDC — a key player in the fight against coronavirus — have consistently been lower than what was spent the previous year. 
However, Congress reshapes presidential recommendations as it sees fit when it crafts final spending bills.
Every year since Trump has been president, lawmakers have passed funding bills — which he has signed — that not only exceeded what Trump requested for emerging infections but also exceeded the previous year’s spending.
As the chart below shows, funding increased every year from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2020. (We have not included the 2017 proposal, since that was submitted by the Obama administration. The figures for 2020 are preliminary.)
!function(e,i,n,s){var t=""InfogramEmbeds"",d=e.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(""script"");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"");
On Feb. 24, Trump asked Congress for a $2.5 billion supplemental budget to help combat the emergence of this coronavirus. House Democrats said the amount was insufficient, and instead passed an $8.3 billion bill that Trump signed March 6. The money will fund efforts to develop a vaccine and help local governments respond to the pandemic. 
Trump ""fired the Pandemic Response Team""
This needs context. ""Fired"" is a strong term for what happened, and Trump recently created a team to lead the government’s response to COVID-19.
In May 2018, Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, the senior director of global health and biodefense on the National Security Council, left the administration. He was in charge of the U.S. response to pandemics.
After Ziemer’s departure, the global health team was reorganized as part of an effort by then-National Security Adviser John Bolton. Meanwhile, Tom Bossert, a homeland security adviser who recommended strong defenses against disease, left shortly after Bolton arrived.

By Tom Kertscher • May 18, 2023







The White House didn’t replace either White House official or his team. Instead, Trump looked within his administration to fill roles for the coronavirus response. 
In January, Trump appointed his Health and Human Services secretary, Alex Azar, to chair a coronavirus task force. On Feb. 26, he announced that Vice President Mike Pence would take charge of the U.S. response to the coronavirus. 
Trump ""refused WHO tests""
This contains a hint of truth, but it’s mostly inaccurate. Former Vice President Joe Biden made a similar claim during the March 15 Democratic presidential debate.
A March 6 Politico article says the World Health Organization shipped coronavirus tests to nearly 60 countries at the end of February, but the U.S. was not among them. That is correct, but it suggests that the U.S. would normally have been on the list, which is not the case.
""No discussions occurred between WHO and CDC about WHO providing COVID-19 tests to the United States,"" said WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris. ""This is consistent with experience since the United States does not ordinarily rely on WHO for reagents or diagnostic tests because of sufficient domestic capacity.""

Instead, the U.S. decided to have the CDC develop its own testing protocol, which was published Jan. 28. This caused a lag in testing for the virus in the U.S.
The CDC’s test was different and more complicated than a test published in Germany on Jan. 17. It worked in the CDC lab, but when the materials went out to state labs, some of them got inconsistent results. The CDC had to resend packages with new chemical reagents.
State laboratories started developing their own tests and were ready to use them, but had to wait for emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration. The combined delays resulted in fewer Americans being tested and a slower U.S. response overall compared with some other countries. 
Trump ""wasted two weeks calling this outbreak a ‘Democrat hoax.’""
This is inaccurate. 
During a Feb. 28 campaign rally in North Charleston, S.C., Trump called the Democratic response to COVID-19 a ""hoax."" But he did not use the term to describe the virus itself.
During a press conference Feb. 29, Trump was asked about his remarks.
""I'm not talking about what's happening here; I'm talking what they're doing,"" he said, referring to Democrats. ""That's the hoax.""
Trump’s comments feed into a conspiracy theory that claims Democrats and the media are fabricating the threat of COVID-19 to hurt the economy and the president’s re-election chances. And the president appeared to downplay the threat of the virus at several points in recent weeks.
But to say that Trump called the virus itself a hoax is false. Plus, the administration took its first action in January by setting up a task force to address the spread of the coronavirus.
",PolitiFact,"
An Instagram post made four claims that criticize Trump’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The first, that he ""cut funding to the CDC,"" is partially accurate; Trump tried to cut the agency’s funding, but Congress prevented it from happening. On the second claim, while saying Trump ""fired"" the ""Pandemic Response Team"" is a stretch, it’s true that National Security Council staffers left abruptly in 2018 and were not replaced. 
The third claim, that Trump ""refused WHO tests,"" contains a hint of truth, but is mostly inaccurate since the U.S. does not usually rely on the WHO for testing protocols. And the fourth claim, which says Trump ""wasted two weeks calling this outbreak a ‘Democrat hoax,’"" is inaccurate — the president has not called the virus itself a ""hoax,"" just the Democrats’ response to it.
As a whole, the Instagram post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

<p>Let’s start with the first part of the claim – the ""tax loophole"" – and rewind back to 2017. </p>
<p>That's when former President Donald Trump proposed a tax overhaul that included a reduction in the corporate tax rate and a repeal of the requirement that all U.S. citizens have health insurance. </p>
<p>To get the measure through the Senate, Trump needed the full support of Republicans, but Johnson announced he would not back the measure. </p>
<p>Johnson insisted that the measure include a tax break for so-called ""pass-through"" companies – those that pass all their income on to the owners or investors. Companies structured this way (often small, family owned businesses) are not subject to corporate income tax.</p>

<p>""Now, did my business benefit? Sure. Did some of my donor businesses? Sure. When you give tax relief to everybody, everybody benefits."" </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Johnson did sell his business for at least $5 million</div>
<p>This part of the claim, on the sale of the business, is the most straightforward.</p>
<p>Johnson’s family-run company – Pacur LLC, an Oshkosh-based plastics company – was created by Johnson along with his brother-in-law in <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/wisconsin/2021/06/07/former-pacur-employee-sues-oshkosh-firm-ties-ron-johnsons-family/7588315002/"">1979</a>. Johnson was CEO of Pacur LLC until he was elected to the Senate in 2010. </p>
<p>He sold his interest in the company to <a href=""https://www.gryphon-inv.com/news-article/gryphon-signs-agreement-to-make-strategic-investment-in-pacur/"">Gryphon Investors</a> in 2020 for between <a href=""https://efdsearch.senate.gov/search/view/ptr/3877f56e-ceb3-4e34-9659-cf52ba9efc5d/"">$5 million and $20 million</a>, according to federal disclosure reports, which only provide a range. He acknowledged he was in talks about a deal to sell as late as 2018 – so, after the tax measure passed the Senate.</p>
<p>The $5 million cited by Opportunity Wisconsin is on the low-end of the range. The actual sale price is unknown, as Johnson is not required to disclose it.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Johnson’s wealth more than doubled – but over different timeframe</div>
<p>For the final part of the statement – on Johnson’s wealth doubling – Opportunity Wisconsin said it based its calculations of Johnson’s wealth on the methodology used by <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances/methodology"">OpenSecrets</a>, the <a href=""https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/FbXZCYEY1vFkQL93KUVu1B7?domain=congressionalintegrity.org/"">Congressional Integrity Project</a> and <a href=""https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/7Tg5CZ6G2ViPE5jM1Tx3Lg_?domain=nbcnews.com"">NBC News</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s how we broke down those numbers:</p>
<p>When Johnson was elected in November 2010, his financial disclosure forms showed assets of between $17,062,029 and $76,836,000. The midpoint of that range is $46,949,015. </p>
<p>In 2011, when Johnson took office, his disclosures showed assets (with no liabilities) totaling between $8,767,016 and $38,743,000. The midpoint of that range is $23,755,008.</p>
<p>So, a lot depends on the starting point. </p>
<p>Fast forward to his <a href=""https://efdsearch.senate.gov/search/view/annual/17a75cba-ab2a-42c3-84e7-7fbfd21d81f3/"">2020 disclosure</a>. In it Johnson’s net worth totalled between $16,951,012 and $79,117,002, with a midpoint of $48,034,007.</p>
<p>This means Johnson more than doubled his wealth. The disclosure forms only provide a range, so precise figures cannot be obtained. But, in any case, Johnson does not dispute it.</p>
<p>Johnson told the <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/04/11/ron-johnson-says-pacur-llc-other-businesses-benefited-2017-tax-cut/9518476002/"">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>: ""When I got elected, I took all my marketable securities (and) I turned them into cash. I’ve just been sitting on cash. The reason my wealth doubled is I finally sold my business. I cashed out on that. … I sat on cash, I'm still sitting on cash.""</p>
<p>Johnson also noted that since he took office, that Standard &amp; Poors 500 Index nearly quadrupled.</p>
<p>""I knew during the COVID recession, this is a really good time to invest (in) the stock market. I didn't,"" he said. ""I should have increased my wealth 3.8 times."" </p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>Opportunity Wisconsin claimed ""Ron Johnson pushed through a special tax loophole that benefited his own family's business … Then he cashed out of the company for $5 million … (he has) doubled his wealth since taking office.""</p>
<p>The change benefitted his business – but also applied to tens of millions of other businesses. And it was hardly a loophole, if it was widely discussed publicly. He did sell his company for at least $5 million, but the doubling of wealth deserves more context: In that period, the S&amp;P Index nearly quadrupled.</p>
<p>So, the overall claim is a mixed bag – it’s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.</p>
<p>That’s our definition for Half True.</p>

</div>]","As a two-term incumbent, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin has a record to run on – and to run against. In addition to Democratic contenders, a series of opposition groups are mining that record to make the case against Johnson.
Into that fray comes Opportunity Wisconsin, which describes itself as representing Wisconsin residents in the fight for economic equity. 
The group launched a TV ad in February that opens with the words ""Dereliction of Duty"" on the screen, and features a man identified only as ""William B."" a U.S. Air Force veteran. Speaking to the camera, the man lays out a three-part claim, complete with footnotes on the screen:
""Ron Johnson pushed through a special tax loophole that benefited his own family's business … Then he cashed out of the company for $5 million … (he has) doubled his wealth since taking office.""
It appears as a simple string of interconnected facts, all based on past reporting. But it comes with its own series of caveats and asterisks that muddy the truth of the claim.
Tax relief benefits Johnson’s business (and others, too)
Let’s start with the first part of the claim – the ""tax loophole"" – and rewind back to 2017. 
That's when former President Donald Trump proposed a tax overhaul that included a reduction in the corporate tax rate and a repeal of the requirement that all U.S. citizens have health insurance. 
To get the measure through the Senate, Trump needed the full support of Republicans, but Johnson announced he would not back the measure. 
Johnson insisted that the measure include a tax break for so-called ""pass-through"" companies – those that pass all their income on to the owners or investors. Companies structured this way (often small, family owned businesses) are not subject to corporate income tax.
In the end, the provision was added to the package, and it passed the Senate with Johnson’s support.
To be sure, Johnson’s family-owned business fell into that pass-through category, as did those of many key supporters. 
Nevertheless, Opportunity Wisconsin missteps when it calls the change a ""loophole"" – the change was well-publicized at the time. And the group mischaracterizes the situation when it suggests the primary beneficiary was Johnson and his family.
Indeed, of the 26 million businesses in the nation in 2014, 95 percent were pass-throughs, according to a May 15, 2017 article published by the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.
But, even that asterisk warrants a footnote.
A ProPublica investigation, published Aug. 11, 2021, found ""that Johnson’s last-minute maneuver benefited two families more than almost any others in the country — both worth billions and both among the senator’s biggest donors.""
The article noted: ""Dick and Liz Uihlein of packaging giant Uline, along with roofing magnate Diane Hendricks, together had contributed around $20 million to groups backing Johnson’s 2016 reelection campaign.""
Finally, in a recording obtained by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, in which Johnson addressed a group of donors on April 8, 2022 in Medford, Johnson acknowledged that he and others benefitted, framing it this way:

Johnson did sell his business for at least $5 million
This part of the claim, on the sale of the business, is the most straightforward.
Johnson’s family-run company – Pacur LLC, an Oshkosh-based plastics company – was created by Johnson along with his brother-in-law in 1979. Johnson was CEO of Pacur LLC until he was elected to the Senate in 2010.

The $5 million cited by Opportunity Wisconsin is on the low-end of the range. The actual sale price is unknown, as Johnson is not required to disclose it.
Johnson’s wealth more than doubled – but over different timeframe
For the final part of the statement – on Johnson’s wealth doubling – Opportunity Wisconsin said it based its calculations of Johnson’s wealth on the methodology used by OpenSecrets, the Congressional Integrity Project and NBC News.
Here’s how we broke down those numbers:
When Johnson was elected in November 2010, his financial disclosure forms showed assets of between $17,062,029 and $76,836,000. The midpoint of that range is $46,949,015.

Fast forward to his 2020 disclosure. In it Johnson’s net worth totalled between $16,951,012 and $79,117,002, with a midpoint of $48,034,007.
This means Johnson more than doubled his wealth. The disclosure forms only provide a range, so precise figures cannot be obtained. But, in any case, Johnson does not dispute it.
Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: ""When I got elected, I took all my marketable securities (and) I turned them into cash. I’ve just been sitting on cash. The reason my wealth doubled is I finally sold my business. I cashed out on that. … I sat on cash, I'm still sitting on cash.""
Johnson also noted that since he took office, that Standard &amp; Poors 500 Index nearly quadrupled.
""I knew during the COVID recession, this is a really good time to invest (in) the stock market. I didn't,"" he said. ""I should have increased my wealth 3.8 times."" 
",PolitiFact,"
Opportunity Wisconsin claimed ""Ron Johnson pushed through a special tax loophole that benefited his own family's business … Then he cashed out of the company for $5 million … (he has) doubled his wealth since taking office.""
The change benefitted his business – but also applied to tens of millions of other businesses. And it was hardly a loophole, if it was widely discussed publicly. He did sell his company for at least $5 million, but the doubling of wealth deserves more context: In that period, the S&amp;P Index nearly quadrupled.
So, the overall claim is a mixed bag – it’s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
That’s our definition for Half True.

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>Democratic candidate for governor Gavin Newsom recently described California as both ""the richest and poorest state."" The economy is booming for many, he said, while millions of others are mired in poverty.</p>
<p>That includes nearly half of the state’s children, when considering the state’s high ""cost-of-living,"" he claimed.</p>
<p>""Close to half of the children (are) at or near poverty,"" Newsom said while <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/GavinNewsom/videos/299507224173190/"">campaigning </a>in Los Angeles County on Sept. 10, 2018. ""How can that be in this place, this extraordinary place, in the world’s <a href=""https://www.sacbee.com/news/business/article210466514.html"">5th largest economy</a>? We must do more and we must do better.""</p>
<p>Did Newsom get his facts right on this sad statistic? We set out on a fact check.</p>
<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>
<p>Newsom’s campaign spokesman said the claim is supported by the July 2018 report ""<a href=""http://www.ppic.org/wp-content/uploads/JTF_ChildPovertyJTF.pdf"">Child Poverty in California</a>."" </p>
<p>That study produced an updated look at what researchers call the California Poverty Measure, which is a joint research effort by the Public Policy Institute of California and the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality to closely examine poverty in the state. </p>
<p>It found that 45.8 percent of children in California were ""at or near poverty"" in 2016, the most recent year examined. That matches with Newsom’s statement of ""close to half.""</p>
<p>But we wanted to know how researchers came up with that number.</p>
<p>Caroline Danielson, a PPIC policy director and co-author of the study, said the California Poverty Measure takes into account California’s high cost-of-living, as well as factors that offset those costs, such as the state’s social safety net programs.</p>
<p>The report found the share of children in poverty was 21 percent. It found an additional nearly 25 percent lived ""near poverty,"" meaning their family incomes was one-and-a-half times the poverty line, Danielson said.</p>
<p>In the report, the income threshold for poverty varies by region.</p>
<p>In a high-cost county, including many places along the coast, the average threshold for a family of four is $30,000 per year, Danielson explained. A family that makes less than that would be considered in poverty.</p>
<p>In that same county, near poverty includes families whose incomes range from $30,000 to $45,000, or one-and-a-half times the poverty line.</p>
<p>Other counties had lower income thresholds.</p>
<p>To reach 45.8 percent figure, the study combined children who live at or near poverty in all regions of the state.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>Danielson said the state’s child poverty rate has declined from 25 percent in 2011, the first year PPIC produced the California Poverty Measure, to 21 percent in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Census figures also support claim</strong></p>
<p>The finding that nearly half of California’s children live at or near poverty is also supported by data in the U.S. Census Bureau’s <a href=""https://www.census.gov/content/census/en/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-265.html"">Supplemental Poverty Measure</a>. An updated version of that report, which also takes into account cost-of-living, was released this month.</p>
<p>For 2016, it found 22.5 percent of California’s children live in poverty while a total of 45 percent live at or near poverty, according to a review of that report’s 2016 public-use dataset conducted by Danielson at our request.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure has gained wide acceptance among researchers over the agency’s Official Poverty Measure, which does not take state-by-state variations in cost into account.</p>
<p>Two researchers, however, raised questions in a recent <a href=""https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/California-s-troubling-poverty-rate-13210928.php"">op-ed</a> in the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> about relying too much on that measure. David Brady, professor of public policy and director of the Blum Initiative on Global and Regional Poverty at UC Riverside and Zachary Parolin, a researcher at the University of Antwerp’s Herman Deleeck Centre for Social Policy, asked ""whether California’s poverty rate should depend so exclusively and overwhelmingly on housing costs.""</p>
<p>They proposed using questions about median income, alongside the supplemental poverty measure, to arrive at poverty rates.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first claim we’ve fact-checked on California’s dismal poverty rate. In January 2017, we rated <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/jan/20/chad-mayes/true-california-has-nations-highest-poverty-rate-w/"">True</a> a claim by Republican Assemblyman Chad Mayes that California had the nation’s highest overall poverty rate, when including children and adults and factoring in cost-of-living. Mayes, at the time, was citing the state’s 20.6 percent overall poverty rate for the period 2013 to 2015.</p>
<p>That rate has dropped slightly but remains the highest in the nation at 19 percent, according to the Supplemental Poverty Measure for 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Newsom’s plan for child poverty</strong></p>
<p>Newsom has described California’s child poverty as ""a moral outrage."" His <a href=""https://gavinnewsom.com/child_poverty"">campaign website</a> includes several proposals for reducing it. They include, among other plans, creating college savings accounts for every incoming kindergartener; expanding the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit for very low-income earners; and increasing CalWORKS grants, a financial assistance program for families in need.</p>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>Democratic candidate for governor Gavin Newsom recently claimed ""close to half of the children"" in California are ""at or near poverty,"" when you consider the state’s cost-of-living.</p>
<p>A July 2018 report by the Public Policy Institute of California backs up Newsom’s statement. It accounts for cost-of-living in each region of the state and found 45.8 percent of the state’s children live at or near poverty.</p>
<p>Another report, the U.S. Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure, also confirms the claim.</p>
<p>Newsom’s statement is supported by credible reports and includes necessary context.</p>
<p>We rate his claim True.</p>

Census figures also support claim

<p>To all the policy wonks tuning into the start of the recent Democratic presidential debate looking for robust discussions of Medicare for All, income inequality or criminal justice policy, sorry.</p>
<p>Factual claims were often obstructed over shouting, cross-talk and scripted soundbites from the seven candidates in Charleston, S.C.</p>
<p>But the facts — or fact-checks — became clearer as the two-hour debate wore on. Sen. Amy Klobuchar even asked for a fact-check live from the stage. We delivered.</p>
<p>Here are the facts from the 10th Democratic presidential debate.</p>
<p><strong>""You didn't write that bill. I wrote that bill. … We’ll have a fact-check look at this."" </strong><em>—  Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.</em></p>
<p><strong>""I wrote the bill, the Violence Against Women Act. … Let's look at the fact-check."" </strong><em>— former Vice President Joe Biden</em></p>
<p>Our verdict? Klobuchar and Biden were talking past each other and about different bills they wrote to protect women against violent crime.</p>
<p>Klobuchar said she authored a bill ""to close the boyfriend loophole that says that domestic abusers can't go out and get an AK-47.""</p>
<p>Biden interjected, ""I wrote that law."" Klobuchar dismissed him, saying she was the one who wrote it. But Biden said that he wrote the Violence Against Women Act, that the ""boyfriend loophole"" was not covered, and that Klobuchar was working on that: ""I couldn’t get that covered. You in fact as a senator tried to get it covered and Mitch McConnell is holding it up on his desk right now.""</p>
<p>Klobuchar in January 2019 introduced a <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/120/text"">bill</a> ""to protect victims of stalking from gun violence."" In a news release, Klobuchar <a href=""https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/1/klobuchar-dingell-introduce-legislation-to-keep-guns-out-of-the-hands-of-stalkers-and-protect-women-from-domestic-abuse"">said</a> her proposal would help close what’s known as the ""boyfriend loophole"" and prevent people who have abused dating partners from buying or owning firearms.</p>
<p>As we have <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/aug/22/amy-klobuchar/boyfriend-loophole-some-convicted-domestic-violenc/"">reported</a>, the gun prohibition in federal law does not apply to a boyfriend who is or was simply dating the victim, but not sharing a residence or children. But it does apply to boyfriends who have a child in common with the domestic violence victim; live or lived with the victim; or who are ""similarly situated to a spouse.""</p>
<p>For his part, Biden championed the Violence Against Women Act as a Democratic senator from Delaware in 1994. The act increased funding and provided additional legal tools for combating violent crimes committed against women.<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., ""said we should primary Barack Obama (in 2012) — someone should.""</strong> <em>— former Vice President Joe Biden</em></p>
<p>In 2011, Sanders publicly suggested that a primary challenge to Obama would be a positive development.</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://www.wnyc.org/story/118406-bernie-sanders-speaking-independently/"">March 2011 on WNYC</a> radio, Sanders said, ""I think, you know, if a Democrat, a progressive Democrat, wants to run, I think it would enliven the debate, raise some issues, and people have a right to do that. I’ve been asked whether I am going to be doing that, and I’m not. I don’t know who is, but in a democracy, it’s not a bad idea to have different voices out there."" </p>
<p>Then, in July 2011, Sanders <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8N8E1v7E58"">appeared</a> on the progressive radio show hosted by Thom Hartmann and <a href=""https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/bernie-sanders-primary-obama-2012-social-security.html"">criticized</a> Obama’s willingness to compromise with Republicans on deficit reduction.</p>
<p>""My suggestion is, I think, you know, one of the reasons the president has been able to move so far to the right is that there is no primary opposition to him,"" Sanders said to a caller. ""And I think it would do this country a good deal of service if people started thinking about candidates out there to begin contrasting what is a progressive agenda, as opposed to what Obama is doing."" </p>
<p>Asked by a caller to Hartmann’s show whether he was encouraging anyone specifically to run, Sanders said, ""At this point I have not. But I am now giving thought to doing it.""</p>

<p><strong>""I believe I'm the only person on this stage who believes in reparations for slavery."" </strong><em>— Tom Steyer</em></p>
<p>That’s inaccurate. Other candidates on stage, like Steyer, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/economic-inequality/reparations/"">support studying reparations</a>. The senators on stage — Klobuchar, Sanders, and Warren — <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1083"">co-sponsored a bill</a> to establish a commission to study and develop reparation proposals for African Americans.</p>
<p>The Washington Post sent the Democratic candidates questionnaires asking where they stood on issues, including reparations. Biden and Buttigieg, like the senators, said they support studying the issue.</p>
<p>Bloomberg did not answer the Post's question. But in January, the Post separately <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mike-bloomberg-at-site-of-racial-massacre-vows-aid-for-african-americans/2020/01/19/90780cd0-3aa3-11ea-baca-eb7ace0a3455_story.html"">reported</a> that Bloomberg’s campaign said he supports studying the concept of federal reparations.</p>
<p>As for Steyer, he said it was uncertain what form a reparations program would take, who would benefit from it or how it would be paid. But he supported creating a Slavery Reconciliation Commission ""to analyze the lasting effects of slavery and how to provide redress for the centuries of oppression, rape, torture, and murder inflicted upon generations of African Americans.""</p>

<p><strong>President Donald Trump ""cut the funding for CDC.""</strong> <em>— former Vice President Joe Biden</em></p>
<p>Trump has consistently proposed funding cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But Congress has consistently overruled him. </p>
<p>Because the comment came during a discussion of the United States’ preparedness for emerging global infections like the new coronavirus, COVID-19, we looked at the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2019/fy-2019-detail-table.pdf"">budgets</a> <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2021/FY-2021-CDC-Budget-Detail.pdf"">for</a> <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2020/fy-2020-detail-table.pdf"">emerging</a> <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2018/fy-2018-cdc-budget-overview.pdf"">and</a> zoonotic infectious diseases at CDC, rather than for the CDC as a whole.</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s initial budget proposal has consistently been lower than what was spent the previous year. The administration proposed $61.7 million less in 2018 than 2017; $96.4 million less in 2019 than in 2018; $114.4 million less in 2020 than in 2019; and $85.3 million less in 2021 than 2020.</p>
<p>However, Congress usually treats any president’s budget proposal as an opening volley, with lawmakers reshaping the federal budget as they see fit when they craft final spending bills.</p>
<p>Every year since Trump has been president, lawmakers have passed bills — bills that were eventually signed by the president — that not only exceeded what Trump had asked for on emerging infections but also exceeded what had been spent the previous year.</p>
<p>As the chart below shows, funding increased every year from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2020. (The figures for 2020 are preliminary.)</p>

<p><strong>""The president fired the pandemic specialists in this country two years ago."" </strong><em>— former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg </em></p>
<p>It’s true that in May 2018, the top White House official who was in charge of the U.S. response to pandemics <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/05/10/top-white-house-official-in-charge-of-pandemic-response-exits-abruptly/"">left the administration</a>. Rear Admiral Timothy Ziemer was the senior director of global health and biodefense on the National Security Council and oversaw global health security issues. That global health team was disbanded after Ziemer’s departure and reorganized as part of a streamlining effort headed by then-National Security Adviser John Bolton. Ziemer’s position on the NSC has not been filled in the last two years. Tom Bossert, a homeland security adviser who recommended strong defenses against disease and biological warfare, also departed in 2018.  </p>
<p>In January, Trump <a href=""https://khn.org/morning-breakout/trump-to-assemble-u-s-task-force-to-tackle-coronavirus-top-health-officials-reiterate-americans-are-at-low-risk/"">announced</a> that Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar would be the chair of the coronavirus task force that’s in charge of the U.S. response to the disease. But many are still urging that this position be filled to coordinate the federal response. </p>
<p>On Feb. 18, a group of 27 senators sent a <a href=""https://www.schatz.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/021320%20NSC%20Novel%20Coronavirus%20Letter%20final%20pdf.pdf"">letter</a> to current National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien to ask him to appoint a new global health security expert to the NSC. </p>

<p><strong>""Sen. Sanders at one point said it was going to be $40 trillion, then 30, then 17. It’s an incredible shrinking price tag. At some point he said it is unknowable to see what the price tag will be.""</strong> <em>— former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg</em></p>
<p>Sanders has cited differing estimates of what Medicare for All would cost.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/postlive/wplive/sen-bernie-sanders-says-medicare-for-all-would-cost-30-to-40-trillion-over-10-year-period/2019/07/16/3c9052b9-9f1e-47ed-bc4e-50e9d7007f36_video.html"">$30 trillion to $40 trillion</a> figure alludes to work done by the<a href=""https://www.urban.org/research/publication/incremental-comprehensive-health-reform-how-various-reform-options-compare-coverage-and-costs""> Urban Institute</a>, a Washington think tank. It is the only analysis to factor in the price of long-term care — one of the most expensive components of the Medicare for All plan — and finds the program would cost $34 trillion in new federal spending over 10 years. (In terms of national health spending, it would result in an increase of $7 trillion over a decade.) The research makes assumptions that Sanders’ bill leaves open-ended, such as estimating what Medicare for All would ultimately pay hospitals and health professionals. </p>
<p>The $17 trillion comes from newer research: a paper released Feb. 15 in the medical journal <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33019-3/fulltext?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=2d1a7809-2d05-4592-9985-239cb8ab0884"">The Lancet</a>. The researchers say Medicare for All would save $450 billion annually. That would bump down the cost significantly, to just about $17 trillion over 10 years. This figure is what Sanders relies on <a href=""https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-does-bernie-pay-his-major-plans/"">in calculating</a> his own plan to finance the single-payer plan. His proposed set of revenues would raise about $17.14 trillion in a decade.</p>
<p>Sanders has also said in <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2020/02/11/the-health-202-2020-democrats-are-schooling-bernie-sanders-on-his-medicare-for-all-math-before-today-s-new-hampshire-primary/5e4179bc88e0fa0a47d9d833/"">at least one interview</a> that the price of Medicare for All is ""impossible to predict."" The switch to single-payer would represent a shift of unprecedented magnitude in American history. And before you can predict what it would cost, you need to decide what you would pay hospitals and doctors. </p>
<p><em>— Shefali Luthra, Kaiser Health News</em></p>
<p><strong>""(A recent study) said ‘Medicare for All’ will lower health care costs in this country by $450 billion a year and save the lives of 68,000 people who would otherwise have died."" — </strong><em>Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt</em></p>
<p>That study does exist. And it cites some evidence. But many of its assumptions are flawed, and experts uniformly told us it overestimates the potential savings. It cherry-picks data in calculating mortality effects. <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/26/bernie-sanders/research-exaggerates-potential-savings/"">We rated Sanders' claim Mostly False</a>. It has some truth, but ignores context that would create a dramatically different impression. </p>
<p>To the researchers’ credit, they acknowledge that their findings are based on uncertain assumptions. But the study seems to downplay costs in several areas. For instance, the researchers calculate $78.2 billion in savings from providing primary care to uninsured people — $70.4 billion from avoided hospitalizations and $7.8 from avoided emergency room visits. But previous evidence suggests that logic is suspect at best. </p>
<p>The researchers also assume that a Medicare for All system would pay hospitals at a maximum of Medicare rates. That’s tricky. </p>
<p>Given the political influence hospitals in particular carry in Congress — where most members are sensitive to their concerns — passing a plan offering such a low payment rate would be politically challenging. And Sanders’ bill doesn’t actually  specify the rates at which hospitals would be paid.</p>

<p><strong>""Barack Obama was abroad in a town meeting. He did not in any way suggest that there was anything positive about the Cuban government. He acknowledged they did increase life expectancy, but he went on and condemned the dictatorship."" </strong><em>— Joe Biden</em></p>
<p>Biden was not correct about the event Sanders was talking about in Argentina. But Obama did take a tougher line in a speech in Cuba.  </p>
<p>After Sanders gave Cuba’s Fidel Castro credit for a <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/24/bernie-sanders/sanders-correct-cuba-literacy-campaign-skimps-prop/"">major literacy program</a>, he faced sharp rebukes from both Republicans and Democrats. In the debate, Sanders noted that President Barack Obama had praised Cuba for the same thing.</p>
<p>Biden shot back that Obama had gone on to condemn the dictatorship. That’s not in the <a href=""https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/23/remarks-president-obama-young-leaders-americas-initiative-town-hall"">official transcript</a> of what Obama told a group of young leaders at an event in Buenos Aires on March 23, 2016:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;"">""I said this to President Castro in Cuba. I said, look, you've made great progress in educating young people. Every child in Cuba gets a basic education — that's a huge improvement from where it was. Medical care, the life expectancy of Cubans is equivalent to the United States, despite it being a very poor country, because they have access to health care. That's a huge achievement. They should be congratulated.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;"">""But you drive around Havana and you say this economy is not working. It looks like it did in the 1950s. And so you have to be practical in asking yourself how can you achieve the goals of equality and inclusion, but also recognize that the market system produces a lot of wealth and goods and services. And it also gives individuals freedom because they have initiative.""</p>
<p>Biden’s office said he was referring to a <a href=""https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/22/remarks-president-obama-people-cuba"">speech Obama gave in Cuba</a>, with Fidel’s brother Raul Castro in the audience. That time, Obama took a tougher line, although in diplomatic terms.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;"">""I believe citizens should be free to speak their mind without fear, to organize, and to criticize their government, and to protest peacefully, and that the rule of law should not include arbitrary detentions of people who exercise those rights. I believe that every person should have the freedom to practice their faith peacefully and publicly.

<p>A <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-republicans-donations.html"">New York Times analysis</a> of Bloomberg’s donations stated that he spent $11.7 million to Toomey in 2016. Since 2012, the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-republicans-donations.html"">New York Times</a> found, Bloomberg has helped candidates from both major parties, but his political committees have given more to Democrats than Republicans. </p>
<p>We used the database of donations posted by the <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/"">Center for Responsive Politics</a> and found that Bloomberg’s <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgave2.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=C00532705"">Independence USA PAC</a> spent <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=C00532705"">$5.9 million in support of Toomey</a> in 2016. As an individual, Bloomberg gave<a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/donor-lookup/results?name=Michael+Bloomberg&amp;cycle=&amp;state=&amp;zip=&amp;employ=Bloomberg&amp;cand=""> $2,700 to Toomey’s campaign</a>. </p>

<p>Warren also said that Bloomberg supported U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Warren’s Senate opponent, Republican Sen. Scott Brown in 2012.</p>
<p>In 2014, Bloomberg gave $250,000 to the <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00543157"">West Main Street Values PAC</a>. That PAC then spent $272,381 for Graham. (Bloomberg was one of many donors to that PAC.) A representative for the PAC told the <a href=""https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/former-new-york-mayor-bloomberg-gives-to-pro-lindsey-graham/article_4553a13c-8cb1-5f46-85d8-ae98ffcc0db5.html"">Post and Courier </a>in 2014 that Bloomberg’s donation related to Graham’s support for Israel and speaking against Iran’s ambitions.</p>
<p>In 2014, Bloomberg <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/nyregion/bloomberg-gives-support-to-senator-scott-brown.html"">endorsed</a> Brown’s re-election when he faced a challenge from Warren. Bloomberg’s spokesman at the time said he was backing Brown because of his support on a gun control measure.

Fake headline says Donna Brazile knows Seth Rich was murdered by Clintons

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>The publication of former interim Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile’s book has revived conspiracy theories about the 2016 shooting death of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich.</p>
<p>A headline on the <a href=""http://uspolitical.org/donna-brazile-knows-seth-rich-was-murdered-by-the-clintons/"">US Political website</a> states, ""Donna Brazile knows Seth Rich was murdered by the Clintons."" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. Our efforts to reach the writer were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>""Why would Brazile have to fear for her life after the Rich murder — if, as we’ve been told, it was simply a robbery gone bad?"" states the article. ""Does she suspect someone of the murder? Does she suspect the Clintons?""</p>
<p>We found nothing in Brazile’s recent book that pins the Rich murder on the Clintons.</p>
<p>Near dawn on July 10, 2016, 27-year-old <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/aug/07/seth-rich-separating-fact-and-speculation/"">Rich was found with two fatal gunshot wounds</a> near his home in Washington, D.C. Rich was had been working on voter access projects for the DNC.</p>
<p>Weeks later, Rich’s death became intertwined with WikiLeaks after it released hacked emails from the DNC. WikiLeaks head Julian Assange suggested in a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg"">Dutch television interview</a> that Rich might have been murdered.</p>
<p>In ""Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House,"" Brazile wrote about the grief and fears she felt in the aftermath of Rich’s murder, even closing the blinds in her office so a sniper couldn’t see her.</p>
<p>Brazile wrote that she felt some responsibility for Rich’s death.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<html><body><p>The national protests over police brutality that started in Minnesota after a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd by kneeling for nearly nine minutes on his neck have now focused squarely on Wisconsin.</p>
<p>On Sunday August 23, 2020, a Kenosha police officer<a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2020/08/26/kenosha-shooting-shots-fired-during-protest-injuries-reported/3441271001/""> shot Jacob Blake</a> in the back multiple times at close range as Blake tried to get into a small SUV. Protests re-ignited across the country, including in Madison and, of course, Kenosha, where buildings were vandalized and burned, windows smashed out and stores looted. </p>
<p>State Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, decried the destruction in an August 25, 2020, news release and Facebook post.  </p>
<p>""There is absolutely no justification for the vandalism, destruction, rioting and looting that took place at the State Capitol, in the City of Madison or the City of Kenosha last night,"" Marklein <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SenMarklein/posts/1666769603485955"">posted on Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>Then he took aim at the state’s Democratic leaders.</p>
<p>""We need leadership in this state to take a stand, protect our citizens and call for peace, rather than capitulating to violent mobs. Governor Tony Evers and Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes made irresponsible comments about the incident in Kenosha before having all of the facts. They did not call for peace. They did not encourage calm."" </p>
<p>The statement came before a night of chaos involving protesters and armed militia members left two men dead and a third man injured. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, of Antioch, Ill., is charged with shooting the men. Rittenhouse is a self-described militia member.</p>
<p>We’ll focus on the last part of Marklein’s claim. </p>
<p>Did Evers and Barnes ""not call for peace"" and ""not encourage calm"" in the wake of the Blake shooting?</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">The evidence</div>
<p>When asked to provide backup for the statement, Katy Prange, Marklein’s chief of staff, focused on the timing and context of statements made by Evers and Barnes.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the sequence.</p>
<p> Here is the complete <a href=""https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/WIGOV/bulletins/29b7e6d"">August 23, 2020 news release</a> from the governor’s office, hours after the incident:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 36pt;"">MADISON — Gov. Evers tonight released the following statement regarding the officer-involved shooting that critically injured a Black man in Kenosha.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 36pt;"">""Tonight, Jacob Blake was shot in the back multiple times, in broad daylight, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Kathy and I join his family, friends, and neighbors in hoping earnestly that he will not succumb to his injuries. While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p style=""margin-left: 36pt;"">We stand with all those who have and continue to demand justice, equity, and accountability for Black lives in our country—lives like those of George Floyd, of Breonna Taylor, Tony Robinson, Dontre Hamilton, Ernest Lacy, and Sylville Smith. And we stand against excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging with Black Wisconsinites.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 36pt;"">I have said all along that although we must offer our empathy, equally important is our action. In the coming days, we will demand just that of elected officials in our state who have failed to recognize the racism in our state and our country for far too long.""</p>
<p>There was no call for peace or calm in the statement.</p>
<p>The following morning, Evers’s office issued a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV30rCI5i3s&amp;feature=youtu.be"">video message</a>: </p>
<p>In the video address, neither Evers nor Barnes mentioned the violence or damage from the previous night, but they did ask that those protesting ""do so peacefully."" </p>
<p>Marklein’s <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SenMarklein/posts/1666769603485955"">statement was posted on Facebook</a> at 11:06 a.m. the next day, August 25. So, that’s our starting point for the accuracy of the claim.</p>
<p>We also looked at Barnes’ tweets and Facebook posts, but did not find any reference to calling for peace or calm prior to Marklein’s post.</p>
<p>In a <a href=""https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/WIGOV/bulletins/29bc5e1"">news release</a> later that day, Evers said: ""Tonight, and in the days ahead, if you are going to protest, please do so peacefully and safely. Please do not allow the actions of a few distract us from the work we must do together to demand justice, equity, and accountability."" </p>
<p>So, clearly, that statement from Evers -- his strongest on the question of peace and calm -- came after Marklein’s claim.</p>

</div>]","The national protests over police brutality that started in Minnesota after a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd by kneeling for nearly nine minutes on his neck have now focused squarely on Wisconsin.
On Sunday August 23, 2020, a Kenosha police officer shot Jacob Blake in the back multiple times at close range as Blake tried to get into a small SUV. Protests re-ignited across the country, including in Madison and, of course, Kenosha, where buildings were vandalized and burned, windows smashed out and stores looted. 
State Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, decried the destruction in an August 25, 2020, news release and Facebook post.  
""There is absolutely no justification for the vandalism, destruction, rioting and looting that took place at the State Capitol, in the City of Madison or the City of Kenosha last night,"" Marklein posted on Facebook.
Then he took aim at the state’s Democratic leaders.
""We need leadership in this state to take a stand, protect our citizens and call for peace, rather than capitulating to violent mobs. Governor Tony Evers and Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes made irresponsible comments about the incident in Kenosha before having all of the facts. They did not call for peace. They did not encourage calm."" 
The statement came before a night of chaos involving protesters and armed militia members left two men dead and a third man injured. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, of Antioch, Ill., is charged with shooting the men. Rittenhouse is a self-described militia member.
We’ll focus on the last part of Marklein’s claim. 
Did Evers and Barnes ""not call for peace"" and ""not encourage calm"" in the wake of the Blake shooting?
The evidence
When asked to provide backup for the statement, Katy Prange, Marklein’s chief of staff, focused on the timing and context of statements made by Evers and Barnes.
Let’s look at the sequence.
 Here is the complete August 23, 2020 news release from the governor’s office, hours after the incident:
MADISON — Gov. Evers tonight released the following statement regarding the officer-involved shooting that critically injured a Black man in Kenosha.
""Tonight, Jacob Blake was shot in the back multiple times, in broad daylight, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Kathy and I join his family, friends, and neighbors in hoping earnestly that he will not succumb to his injuries. While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country.

stated on April 23, 2023 in a post








People are participating in “National Rape Day’” on April 24.












By Gabrielle Settles • April 24, 2023







We stand with all those who have and continue to demand justice, equity, and accountability for Black lives in our country—lives like those of George Floyd, of Breonna Taylor, Tony Robinson, Dontre Hamilton, Ernest Lacy, and Sylville Smith. And we stand against excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging with Black Wisconsinites.
I have said all along that although we must offer our empathy, equally important is our action. In the coming days, we will demand just that of elected officials in our state who have failed to recognize the racism in our state and our country for far too long.""
There was no call for peace or calm in the statement.
The following morning, Evers’s office issued a video message: 
In the video address, neither Evers nor Barnes mentioned the violence or damage from the previous night, but they did ask that those protesting ""do so peacefully."" 
Marklein’s statement was posted on Facebook at 11:06 a.m. the next day, August 25. So, that’s our starting point for the accuracy of the claim.
We also looked at Barnes’ tweets and Facebook posts, but did not find any reference to calling for peace or calm prior to Marklein’s post.
In a news release later that day, Evers said: ""Tonight, and in the days ahead, if you are going to protest, please do so peacefully and safely. Please do not allow the actions of a few distract us from the work we must do together to demand justice, equity, and accountability."" 
So, clearly, that statement from Evers -- his strongest on the question of peace and calm -- came after Marklein’s claim.
Britt Cudaback, Evers’ deputy communications director, argued Evers had called for a peaceful protest the day before Marklein’s claim, citing the video message
Barnes’ communications director Chet Agni, said Marklein was making ""broad claims."" 
""Our administration has been calling for people to exercise their First Amendment rights peacefully and safely since before Sen. Marklein released his statement, just as our administration did during the unrest following the murder of George Floyd months ago,"" he said in an email.
That said, our research, and the information provided by the offices of Evers and Barnes, shows a single reference to ""peacefully"" before the Marklein statement was made.
",PolitiFact,"
Marklein claimed that Evers and Barnes,  after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, ""did not call for peace. They did not encourage calm.""
The governor did not call for peace and calm in his statement hours after the incident. But in a video statement posted the next day, Evers urged people planning to protest to ""do so peacefully.""
That said, his most direct comments -- saying the Kenosha protests went too far -- didn’t come until after Marklein’s statement. 
We rate Marklein’s claim Mostly False.

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>Wisconsin’s prison system has been in the headlines, from problems at the Lincoln Hills School for Boys, the state’s juvenile facility, to an incident in which a Department of Corrections sergeant exposed the names of <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/31/death-threats-surface-after-prison-sergeant-outs-inmates-rats/2738366002/"">confidential informants</a> at the prison in Redgranite.</p>
<p>The agency’s troubles have attracted plenty of comment from state lawmakers, including State Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, who tossed in some numbers in a May 21, 2019, <a href=""https://twitter.com/ChrisTaylorWI/status/1130891485878996993"">tweet</a>.</p>
<p>""Our corrections system didn’t become a mess overnight. It is a result of the last 8 years of neglect where we saw the prison population expand and vacancy rates for correctional officers go from 2.9% to 15.2%.""</p>
<p>Is Taylor correct that Wisconsin has seen an expanded prison population -- and more openings for correctional officers -- over the past eight years?</p>
<p><strong>Digging into the numbers</strong></p>
<p>As with other criticism from Democrats, there is no coincidence to the eight-year marking point -- that mirrors the time Republicans had total control in Madison.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the prison population, and a <a href=""http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lab/media/2840/19-4highlights.pdf"">May 2019 report from the Legislative Audit Bureau</a>. The nonpartisan audit bureau noted the prison population declined from 2009 to 2011 (from 22,672 to 21,941), but has grown since then.</p>
<p>As the report notes, ""the inmate population grew from 21,941 in 2011 to 23,675 in 2018, or by 7.9 percent.""</p>
<p>So, Taylor is on track with the prison population</p>
<p>What about correctional officer vacancies?</p>
<p>According to the <a href=""http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lab/media/2840/19-4highlights.pdf"">May 2019 audit bureau</a> report, the turnover rate for correctional officers increased from 17.8 percent in fiscal year 2013-’14 to 26.1 percent in fiscal year 2017-’18.</p>
<p>""We found that employee turnover for adult corrections increased from 18.6 percent in fiscal year 2013-’14 to 24.0 percent in fiscal year 2017-’18,"" the report said. ""The turnover rate for correctional officers increased the most, growing from 17.8 percent to 26.1 percent and varied substantially among institutions.""</p>
<p>That’s fine for what it is, but Taylor’s claim was for an eight-year period.</p>
<p>For those numbers, we turned to data from the state Department of Corrections.</p>
<p>The department’s <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6025695-FY11-FY19-Thru-PP07-DAI-Correctional-Officer.html"">data</a> on correctional officer and sergeant vacancies (excluding Wisconsin Correctional Center System sites) from 2011 to 2019 shows steady increases, except for a dip in 2017, in vacant positions:</p>
<p>2011 -- 2.87%</p>
<p>2012 -- 5.49%</p>
<p>2013 -- 6.43%</p>
<p>2014 -- 6.46%</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>2015 -- 7.62%</p>
<p>2016 -- 11.25%</p>
<p>2017 -- 10.97%</p>
<p>2018 -- 12.36%</p>
<p>2019 -- 15.27% (through May 11, 2019)</p>
<p>So, Taylor is on target on that part of the claim as well.</p>
<p><strong>What’s behind the numbers?</strong></p>
<p>Corrections officials have said the state’s low unemployment rate makes it hard to hire and keep workers. As a result, <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/11/overtime-wisconsin-prisons-tops-50-million/2539860002/"">overtime continues to increase.</a></p>
<p>According to a May 2, 2019,  <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/02/gov-tony-evers-gives-5-hour-raises-officers-six-prisons/3652202002/"">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a> report, state agencies spent $80.9 million on overtime in 2018, with most of it — nearly $50 million — going to Department of Corrections workers.</p>
<p>Daniel Meehan, a retired sergeant at Waupun Correctional Institution, blamed the worker shortage and rising overtime on Act 10, the 2011 law that dramatically curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees. Raising wages won't fix the staffing problem on its own, he told the Journal Sentinel.</p>
<p>""In corrections, the job is undesirable,"" said Meehan, who worked for the<a href=""https://projects.jsonline.com/database/2019/4/Wisconsin-state-employee-salaries-2018.html#!/grosspay18.desc.1/agencyname=dept+of+corrections&amp;grosspay18%5Bmin%5D=-3987&amp;grosspay18%5Bmax%5D=963620&amp;totot18%5Bmin%5D=-1263&amp;totot18%5Bmax%5D=122382/""> Department of Corrections</a> from 1981 to 2015. ""Nobody wants to do it anymore. Nobody’s applying for the job, and the ones that do, quit.""</p>
<p><strong>What’s ahead?</strong></p>
<p>On May 2, 2019, Gov. Tony Evers’ administration announced temporary raises of $5 an hour to workers at six prisons in hopes of curbing long-running staff shortages at those institutions.</p>
<p>Until at least June 2020, <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/02/gov-tony-evers-gives-5-hour-raises-officers-six-prisons/3652202002/"">officers and sergeants</a> will get additional pay for shifts at Columbia, Dodge, Green Bay, Taycheedah and Waupun correctional institutions. The bonus will also be paid to workers at Lincoln Hills.  </p>
<p>These institutions will now pay new workers $21.65 an hour — 30% more than the $16.65 an hour paid to those starting at most Wisconsin prisons. Veteran employees at the six institutions will also get pay boosts of $5 an hour -- an increase of more than $10,000 a year.</p>
<p>The move was criticized by some since it leaves out officers and sergeants at more than a dozen other prisons and raised concerns that staff shortages at some institutions would widen if workers decided to transfer to the prisons that are paying more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, under a plan adopted May 22, 2019, by Republicans on the Legislature's budget committee, starting wages for Wisconsin prison guards would go up by more than 14% over two years — from $16.65 an hour to $19 an hour. More senior officers would also get raises of $2.35 an hour by 2021. Most other state employees would get 2% raises in each of the next two years, as Evers recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>Taylor claimed ""We saw the prison population expand and vacancy rates for correctional officers go from 2.9% to 15.2%"" over the last eight years.</p>
<p>The Legislative Audit Bureau said the adult inmate population has increased in the last eight years, from 21,941 in 2011 to 23,675 in 2018, or by 7.9%. And Corrections Department numbers show she is correct about the staffing vacancies as well.</p>
<p>We rate the claim True.</p>

</div>]","Wisconsin’s prison system has been in the headlines, from problems at the Lincoln Hills School for Boys, the state’s juvenile facility, to an incident in which a Department of Corrections sergeant exposed the names of confidential informants at the prison in Redgranite.
The agency’s troubles have attracted plenty of comment from state lawmakers, including State Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, who tossed in some numbers in a May 21, 2019, tweet.
""Our corrections system didn’t become a mess overnight. It is a result of the last 8 years of neglect where we saw the prison population expand and vacancy rates for correctional officers go from 2.9% to 15.2%.""
Is Taylor correct that Wisconsin has seen an expanded prison population -- and more openings for correctional officers -- over the past eight years?
Digging into the numbers
As with other criticism from Democrats, there is no coincidence to the eight-year marking point -- that mirrors the time Republicans had total control in Madison.
Let’s start with the prison population, and a May 2019 report from the Legislative Audit Bureau. The nonpartisan audit bureau noted the prison population declined from 2009 to 2011 (from 22,672 to 21,941), but has grown since then.
As the report notes, ""the inmate population grew from 21,941 in 2011 to 23,675 in 2018, or by 7.9 percent.""
So, Taylor is on track with the prison population
What about correctional officer vacancies?
According to the May 2019 audit bureau report, the turnover rate for correctional officers increased from 17.8 percent in fiscal year 2013-’14 to 26.1 percent in fiscal year 2017-’18.
""We found that employee turnover for adult corrections increased from 18.6 percent in fiscal year 2013-’14 to 24.0 percent in fiscal year 2017-’18,"" the report said. ""The turnover rate for correctional officers increased the most, growing from 17.8 percent to 26.1 percent and varied substantially among institutions.""
That’s fine for what it is, but Taylor’s claim was for an eight-year period.
For those numbers, we turned to data from the state Department of Corrections.
The department’s data on correctional officer and sergeant vacancies (excluding Wisconsin Correctional Center System sites) from 2011 to 2019 shows steady increases, except for a dip in 2017, in vacant positions:
2011 -- 2.87%
2012 -- 5.49%
2013 -- 6.43%
2014 -- 6.46%

Says Social Security is a “legal Ponzi scheme.”












By Vanessa Swales • May 5, 2023







2015 -- 7.62%
2016 -- 11.25%
2017 -- 10.97%
2018 -- 12.36%
2019 -- 15.27% (through May 11, 2019)
So, Taylor is on target on that part of the claim as well.
What’s behind the numbers?
Corrections officials have said the state’s low unemployment rate makes it hard to hire and keep workers. As a result, overtime continues to increase.
According to a May 2, 2019,  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report, state agencies spent $80.9 million on overtime in 2018, with most of it — nearly $50 million — going to Department of Corrections workers.
Daniel Meehan, a retired sergeant at Waupun Correctional Institution, blamed the worker shortage and rising overtime on Act 10, the 2011 law that dramatically curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees. Raising wages won't fix the staffing problem on its own, he told the Journal Sentinel.
""In corrections, the job is undesirable,"" said Meehan, who worked for the Department of Corrections from 1981 to 2015. ""Nobody wants to do it anymore. Nobody’s applying for the job, and the ones that do, quit.""
What’s ahead?
On May 2, 2019, Gov. Tony Evers’ administration announced temporary raises of $5 an hour to workers at six prisons in hopes of curbing long-running staff shortages at those institutions.
Until at least June 2020, officers and sergeants will get additional pay for shifts at Columbia, Dodge, Green Bay, Taycheedah and Waupun correctional institutions. The bonus will also be paid to workers at Lincoln Hills.  
These institutions will now pay new workers $21.65 an hour — 30% more than the $16.65 an hour paid to those starting at most Wisconsin prisons. Veteran employees at the six institutions will also get pay boosts of $5 an hour -- an increase of more than $10,000 a year.
The move was criticized by some since it leaves out officers and sergeants at more than a dozen other prisons and raised concerns that staff shortages at some institutions would widen if workers decided to transfer to the prisons that are paying more.
Meanwhile, under a plan adopted May 22, 2019, by Republicans on the Legislature's budget committee, starting wages for Wisconsin prison guards would go up by more than 14% over two years — from $16.65 an hour to $19 an hour. More senior officers would also get raises of $2.35 an hour by 2021. Most other state employees would get 2% raises in each of the next two years, as Evers recommended.
<strong",PolitiFact,"
Taylor claimed ""We saw the prison population expand and vacancy rates for correctional officers go from 2.9% to 15.2%"" over the last eight years.
The Legislative Audit Bureau said the adult inmate population has increased in the last eight years, from 21,941 in 2011 to 23,675 in 2018, or by 7.9%. And Corrections Department numbers show she is correct about the staffing vacancies as well.

<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>A Democratic legislator maintains lawmakers in 2017 can step up spending on education and other necessities partly by tapping the state’s so-called rainy day fund.</p>
<p>As things stand, Donna Howard of Austin wrote in a September 2016 <a href=""http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/opinion/donna-howard-painless-solutions-for-the-texas-budg/nsZSy/"">commentary</a> in the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em>: ""Thirty-one percent of school districts are still receiving less funding per pupil than they did prior to the dramatic budget cuts of 2011.""</p>
<p>We wondered if that was so.</p>
<p>2011, to refresh, was when the Republican-led Legislature <a href=""http://politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/apr/12/susan-combs/comptroller-susan-combs-says-state-lawmakers-did-n/"">addressed a projected revenue shortfall in part by revising school funding formulas</a>. Those changes and other cuts resulted in school districts getting $5 billion less in state aid through August 2013 compared to what districts likely would have fielded otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Aide: Howard drew on state prediction</strong></p>
<p>Asked how Howard reached her 31 percent conclusion, Jacob Cottingham in her office told us she relied on a Legislative Budget Board staff projection.</p>
<p>Cottingham forwarded a Sept. 21, 2016, email from Andy MacLaurin, a board manager, containing a splash of the state’s legendarily <a href=""https://www.texastribune.org/2011/03/31/how-to-navigate-texas-school-finance-system/"">acronymic funding formulas</a>. M&amp;O refers to school maintenance and operations funding and <a href=""http://tea.texas.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147511834"">WADA refers to</a> the ""weighted average daily attendance"" student counts used by the state to calculate how much a district stands to get in state and local aid, taking into account varied student needs.</p>
<p>MacLaurin wrote that according to the 2015 projection, 31.3 percent of the state’s 1,000-plus school districts ""were projected to have a lower M&amp;O revenue per WADA"" in fiscal 2016 ""than they did in fiscal year 2011 while in fiscal year 2017,"" MacLaurin said, ""23.8 percent of districts were projected to have a lower M&amp;O revenue per WADA than in fiscal year 2011.""</p>
<p>So, there’s Howard’s stated 31 percent. Then again, the projection indicated, fewer districts (nearly 24 percent) were expected to get less aid per student in fiscal 2017 (the current fiscal year) compared with 2011.</p>
<p>Also, MacLaurin’s email signaled more analysis to come, stating: ""However, please note that these figures are based on the model the LBB has used since the end of last session; this fall, we'll be updating the model with new student counts and property value estimates which are likely to change these percentages.""</p>
<p>Next, we followed up with LBB staff spokesman R.J. DeSilva who emailed us district-by-district aid projections behind the information sent to Howard.</p>
<p>DeSilva also noted that the cited projection, developed in May 2015, indicated that on average, school districts were projected to field more aid per student in fiscal 2016 ($6,149) and 2017 ($6,098) than the districts got in fiscal 2011 ($5,734).</p>
<p><strong>Actual spending data</strong></p>
<p>Enough of projections; we hunted up-to-date spending data.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<p>We initially queried the <a href=""https://www.tasb.org/About-TASB.aspx"">Texas Association of School Boards</a>, which advocates at the Capitol, where Dax Gonzalez referred us to the <a href=""http://www.tasbo.org/about-tasbo/about-us/tasbo-strategy-values"">Texas Association of School Business Officials</a>, which trains school finance and operations professionals.</p>
<p>Later, at our request, <a href=""http://connect.tasbo.org/people/thomas-canby"">Tom Canby</a> of TASBO developed and emailed us a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YtYxo0f9VZZY8-nDBI-0SEzkFNjn-ixK8seqD4ggmRs/edit?usp=sharing"">spreadsheet</a>, drawing on audited revenues reported to the Texas Education Agency. The spreadsheet, which adjusted for inflation, indicates that compared with fiscal 2011, 395 of the state’s 1,024 districts, or 38 percent, fielded less state and local funding per student in fiscal 2015, the latest year of available data. Canby said he focused on M&amp;O aid, leaving out aid related to debt service or capital projects. Also, when applicable, he said, he did not take into account ""Robin Hood"" payments from property-wealthy districts to others as required by law.</p>
<p>We spotted another way to break down the figures. Again adjusted for inflation, the districts fielding less per-student state and local aid in 2015 served 1.1 million students, or 22 percent of nearly 5 million students statewide. Flip side: More than 3.8 million students, 78 percent, attended schools in districts that got more such aid per student.</p>
<p>According to the spreadsheet, the Austin, North East, Frisco, Round Rock and Clear Creek districts were the largest districts that drew less state plus local aid per student in 2015 compared with 2011. Highest-enrollment districts fielding more of such per-student aid in 2015 were the Houston, Dallas, Cypress-Fairbanks, Northside and Fort Worth districts.</p>
<p>Canby, asked why certain districts were getting less aid per student than four years before, replied that how school funding works in Texas is so convoluted, ""there is no simple plain English explanation.""</p>
<p><strong>Why do some districts get less than before?</strong></p>
<p>We reached a sanded-down explanation after hearing more from Canby and eliciting the detailed <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xWxYUIQ_gk_T8VK0V64i2HpYoRp2gHeiVBNa_aCkLVE/pub"">emailed analysis</a> of Amanda Brownson, research director for Raise Your Hand Texas, an advocacy group <a href=""http://www.raiseyourhandtexas.org/about/"">that says</a> it focuses on giving every student access to high-quality public education.</p>
<p>Basically, some districts have remained short of making up for plummets in local revenue touched off by state lawmakers a decade past.</p>
<p>In that 2006 special session, members voted to drive down local school property tax rates as championed by then-Gov. Rick Perry. Lawmakers also agreed to shore up districts by filling the self-created revenue gaps with state aid but that move was accompanied by a stipulation that a district would no longer draw the shore-up or ""hold harmless"" aid once oft-tweaked state education funding formulas delivered enough money to make up the difference.</p>
<p>One more pivot: in 2011, revenue-strapped lawmakers shaved the shore-up or ""hold-harmless"" money--a move that remains in effect--delaying full recovery for some districts.</p>
<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
<p>Howard said 31 percent of Texas districts are receiving less funding per pupil than they did prior to the 2011 ""budget cuts.""</p>
<p>Howard’s assessment was based on a 16-month-old projection while actual results appear to have been worse. Inflation-adjusted data suggest 38 percent of districts fielded less state and local aid per student in fiscal 2015 than before the 2011 reductions.</p>
<p>We rate Howard’s statement Mostly True.</p>

MacLaurin wrote that according to the 2015 projection, 31.3 percent of the state’s 1,000-plus school districts ""were projected to have a lower M&amp;O revenue per WADA"" in fiscal 2016 ""than they did in fiscal year 2011 while in fiscal year 2017,"" MacLaurin said, ""23.8 percent of districts were projected to have a lower M&amp;O revenue per WADA than in fiscal year 2011.""
So, there’s Howard’s stated 31 percent. Then again, the projection indicated, fewer districts (nearly 24 percent) were expected to get less aid per student in fiscal 2017 (the current fiscal year) compared with 2011.
Also, MacLaurin’s email signaled more analysis to come, stating: ""However, please note that these figures are based on the model the LBB has used since the end of last session; this fall, we'll be updating the model with new student counts and property value estimates which are likely to change these percentages.""
Next, we followed up with LBB staff spokesman R.J. DeSilva who emailed us district-by-district aid projections behind the information sent to Howard.
DeSilva also noted that the cited projection, developed in May 2015, indicated that on average, school districts were projected to field more aid per student in fiscal 2016 ($6,149) and 2017 ($6,098) than the districts got in fiscal 2011 ($5,734).
Actual spending data
Enough of projections; we hunted up-to-date spending data.

Gavin Newsom


stated on May 7, 2023 in a tweet








Texas Gov. Greg Abbott “cut $211 million in mental health funding.”












By Sarah Bahari • May 9, 2023







We initially queried the Texas Association of School Boards, which advocates at the Capitol, where Dax Gonzalez referred us to the Texas Association of School Business Officials, which trains school finance and operations professionals.
Later, at our request, Tom Canby of TASBO developed and emailed us a spreadsheet, drawing on audited revenues reported to the Texas Education Agency. The spreadsheet, which adjusted for inflation, indicates that compared with fiscal 2011, 395 of the state’s 1,024 districts, or 38 percent, fielded less state and local funding per student in fiscal 2015, the latest year of available data. Canby said he focused on M&amp;O aid, leaving out aid related to debt service or capital projects. Also, when applicable, he said, he did not take into account ""Robin Hood"" payments from property-wealthy districts to others as required by law.
We spotted another way to break down the figures. Again adjusted for inflation, the districts fielding less per-student state and local aid in 2015 served 1.1 million students, or 22 percent of nearly 5 million students statewide. Flip side: More than 3.8 million students, 78 percent, attended schools in districts that got more such aid per student.
According to the spreadsheet, the Austin, North East, Frisco, Round Rock and Clear Creek districts were the largest districts that drew less state plus local aid per student in 2015 compared with 2011. Highest-enrollment districts fielding more of such per-student aid in 2015 were the Houston, Dallas, Cypress-Fairbanks, Northside and Fort Worth districts.
Canby, asked why certain districts were getting less aid per student than four years before, replied that how school funding works in Texas is so convoluted, ""there is no simple plain English explanation.""
Why do some districts get less than before?
We reached a sanded-down explanation after hearing more from Canby and eliciting the detailed emailed analysis of Amanda Brownson, research director for Raise Your Hand Texas, an advocacy group that says it focuses on giving every student access to high-quality public education.
Basically, some districts have remained short of making up for plummets in local revenue touched off by state lawmakers a decade past.
In that 2006 special session, members voted to drive down local school property tax rates as championed by then-Gov. Rick Perry. Lawmakers also agreed to shore up districts by filling the self-created revenue gaps with state aid but that move was accompanied by a stipulation that a district would no longer draw the shore-up or ""hold harmless"" aid once oft-tweaked state education funding formulas delivered enough money to make up the difference.
One more pivot: in 2011, revenue-strapped lawmakers shaved the shore-up or ""hold-harmless"" money--a move that remains in effect--delaying full recovery for some districts.
<strong",PolitiFact,"
Howard said 31 percent of Texas districts are receiving less funding per pupil than they did prior to the 2011 ""budget cuts.""
Howard’s assessment was based on a 16-month-old projection while actual results appear to have been worse. Inflation-adjusted data suggest 38 percent of districts fielded less state and local aid per student in fiscal 2015 than before the 2011 reductions.

</div>]","The night before the Senate began the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, Newsmax TV host Greg Kelly falsely claimed that only one person died Jan. 6 during the U.S. Capitol riot at the center of the push to convict Trump.
""They’ve been lying about so much, including, by the way, that five people died on Jan. 6, 2021,"" Kelly said Feb. 8. ""It's not true. Only one person died on that day. You know who it was? The unarmed woman, Ashli Babbitt. Unarmed woman shot and killed by Capitol Police.""

Kelly was wrong about the Capitol siege’s human toll. A spokesperson for Newsmax declined to comment.
In addition to Babbitt, three others died Jan. 6 from medical emergencies suffered during the riot, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department confirmed. A fifth person, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, died the next day after responding to the riot.
Two other officers who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 — D.C. police officer Jeffery Smith and Capitol Police officer Howard Liebengood — died by suicide in the weeks that followed, acting Metropolitan Police Chief Robert J. Contee III said Jan. 26 in testimony before Congress.
The head of the Capitol Police officers’ union said about 140 officers were injured.
Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran and supporter of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer as she climbed through a smashed door leading to the hallway outside the House chambers. Her death was captured on video.

According to the New York Times and other news outlets, the three other Trump supporters who died during the events included 55-year-old Kevin Greeson of Alabama, who suffered a heart attack; 50-year-old Benjamin Philips of Pennsylvania, who suffered a stroke; and 34-year-old Rosanne Boyland of Georgia, who died as fellow rioters fought through a police line. 
A friend who was with Boyland told WGCL-TV she was pinned to the ground and trampled by fellow rioters, which lines up with the New York Times’ reporting based on videos from the event that she ""died after losing consciousness in the crush of a pro-Trump mob."" An incident report published by Snopes said officers dispatched to the Capitol found her collapsed and receiving CPR.
Contee reported all four deaths in a press conference Jan. 6. News reports from the day, including a fact-check from PolitiFact, also said four people had died in the violence.
Capitol Police announced Sicknick’s death in a press release Jan. 7, writing that the officer died at roughly 9:30 p.m. that day ""due to injuries sustained while on-duty."" Sicknick was injured while ""physically engaging with protesters"" on Jan. 6, and he collapsed after he returned to his division office, the press release said.
Investigations into Sicknick’s death are ongoing.
",PolitiFact,"
Kelly said, ""It's not true (that five people died on Jan. 6). Only one person died on that day. You know who it was? The unarmed woman, Ashli Babbitt.""
That’s inaccurate. Four people died at the Capitol riot on Jan. 6. Sicknick, a Capitol Police officer, died the following day after he was injured in the violence.
We rate Kelly’s statement False.

<p><a href=""https://scudderforsenate.com"">Kendall Scudder</a> of Sulphur Springs said at a July 2, 2018, event <a href=""https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2018-elections/2018/07/08/right-left-contests-lt-governor-texas-senate-offer-clear-contrast-democratic-challengers-gop-incumbents"">noted</a> by the <em>Dallas Morning News</em>:  ""None of you should be surprised to find out that Bob Hall never successfully passed a bill before. And we're going to keep it that way.""</p>
<p>Hall, a businessman who joined the Senate’s ruling Republicans in 2015, told the newspaper: ""I'm not one to try to get my name in lights when it comes to passing bills. I see myself as part of a team.""</p>

</h2>
</header>
<div adbridg-ad-class=""mobileinterstitial""></div>
<article class=""m-textblock"">
<html><body><p>Confederate-themed posts are cropping up on social media in the wake of the Unite the Right march in Charlottesville, Va.</p>
<p>The march was sparked by efforts to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and included some marchers carrying Confederate symbols.</p>
<p>One viral post sent to us by a reader said, ""At the PEAK of slavery in 1860, only 1.4% of Americans owned slaves. What your history books doesn’t tell you is that 3,000 blacks owned a total of 20,000 slaves the same year."" The post is signed, ""Proud Southern Deplorable - Southern Rebel"" and goes on to say, ""If you're sick of the race baiting, please LIKE and SHARE.""</p>
<div class=""artembed""><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OyaxUJSai2XCXhs3lgKea3KvP271T-bC3QumksUjdStcepXNziey7firIJkT3DI_zQEHvx9fX7Z6r5dOEAh0P6b-aXZWs73KaBavlTHYaxLikwkW2fNwtc6ZiajhlpTcC1A4h4uB""/></div>
<p> </p>
<p>When we took a closer look, we found that the percentage of slaveholding families was dramatically higher than what the meme said, and that the number of slaves owned by blacks was presented in a misleading way.</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">'At the PEAK of Slavery in 1860, Only 1.4% of Americans owned slaves.'</div>
<p>The primary source of data about slaves and slaveholding in 1860 is that year’s census.</p>
<p>Census data from 1860 isn’t perfect, said University of North Carolina historian Joseph T. Glatthaar, author of <em><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Soldiering-Army-Northern-Virginia-Statistical-ebook/dp/B0057HB1DG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503589814&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Soldiering+in+the+Army+of+Northern+Virginia%3A+A+Statistical+Portrait+of+the+Troops+Who+Served+under+Robert+E.+Lee"">Soldiering in the Army of Northern Virginia: A Statistical Portrait of the Troops Who Served under Robert E. Lee</a></em>. But it remains ""the best evidence we have.""</p>
<p>In the big picture, the <a href=""https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/histstats-colonial-1970.pdf"">1860 Census</a> counted a total of 31,443,321 people, of which 3,953,760 were slaves. So slaves accounted for 12.6 percent of the national population.</p>
<p>However, to address the assertion in the post requires more detailed data. Many states had outlawed slavery by 1860, so the national population figure dilutes the measurement by including many Americans whose states did not allow them to own slaves. The national population figure also includes slaves and children, and it doesn’t account either for family groupings or how many slaves a given family owned.</p>
<p>So experts say that a more accurate measure of slaveholding in 1860 America would focus on states that allowed slavery, and would zero in on family or household units, as a way of limiting the statistical noise caused by counting slaves and children.</p>
<p>""The number that really matters is how many American households in the South had slaves,"" said Adam Goodheart, a Washington College historian and author of <em><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/1861-Civil-Awakening-Adam-Goodheart/dp/1400032199/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503593400&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=adam+goodheart"">1861: The Civil War Awakening</a>. </em></p>
<p>Using Census data to research his book, Glatthaar calculated that 4.9 percent of people in the slaveholding states owned slaves, that 19.9 percent of family units in those states owned slaves, and that 24.9 percent of households owned slaves. (Households are a broader category than families.)</p>
<div class=""artembed""><a id=""see-figure-1-on-politifactcom""></a><div class=""infogram-embed"" data-id=""8428d60a-7c8b-4f09-a8ab-d23ac9ce3085"" data-title=""Slaveholding by personal or family unit, 1860"" data-type=""interactive""></div><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(""script""),d=o[0],r=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=r+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var a=e.createElement(""script"");a.async=1,a.id=s,a.src=i,d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"",""//e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");</script></div>
<p>Each of these figures is significantly higher than the 1.4 percent cited in the social media post.</p>
<p>State-by-state <a href=""http://www.civil-war.net/pages/1860_census.html"">figures</a> show some variation. In Mississippi, 49 percent of families owned slaves, and in South Carolina, 46 percent did. In border states, the percentage was lower -- 3 percent in Delaware and 12 percent in Maryland. The median for slaveholding states was about 27 percent.</p>
<p>Using the same data, it's possible to calculate the statistic of dubious value cited in the viral image -- the percentage of all American families that owned slaves. The answer: 7.4 percent, which about five times greater than what the meme says.</p><div><html><body><section class=""o-pick"">

<div class=""pf_subheadline"">'3,000 blacks owned a total of 20,000 slaves the same year.'</div>
<p>We were unable to find hard data to debunk -- or support -- this figure.</p>
<p>The most solid data we found was published in an article in <a href=""https://www.theroot.com/did-black-people-own-slaves-1790895436"">the Root</a> by Henry Louis Gates Jr., a Harvard University historian. Gates cited research by Carter G. Woodson, an African-American historian who died in 1950. He found that in 1830, a total of ""3,776 free Negroes owned 12,907 slaves.""</p>
<p>With three more decades of population growth, it’s plausible that the number of black-owned slaves could have grown to 20,000 by 1860, historians told us.</p>
<p>""I'd imagine that the (20,000 figure) quoted in the meme is probably not that far off from being true,"" said Junius Rodriguez, a Eureka College historian and author of <em><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Slavery-United-States-Historical-Encyclopedia/dp/1851095446/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503587412&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=junius+rodriguez"">Slavery in the United States: A Social, Political, and Historical Encyclopedia</a></em>.</p>
<p>But the 20,000 number is not necessarily as eye-popping as the meme makes it out to be.</p>
<p>For starters, even if the number is accurate, it would still account for just a tiny percentage of all slaves held in the United States in 1860 -- specifically, one half of 1 percent. That runs contrary to the post’s framing.</p>
<p>""That’s a very small number compared to Latin American or Caribbean societies,"" said Stephanie McCurry, a Columbia University historian and author of <em><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Confederate-Reckoning-Power-Politics-Civil/dp/0674064216/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503587767&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=stephanie+mccurry"">Confederate Reckoning: Power and Politics in the Civil War South</a></em>.</p>
<p>In addition, the figure is almost certainly inflated by a legal quirk in most antebellum southern states.</p>
<p>It includes ""many ‘owned’ family members whom they had purchased to become free,"" said Eric Foner, a Columbia University historian and the author of such books as <em><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Fiery-Trial-Abraham-Lincoln-American/dp/039334066X/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503588308&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=eric+foner"">The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery</a></em>. ""You could not free a slave in most southern states without sending them out of the state.""</p>
<p>Gates, writing in the Root, noted that the late historian Thomas J. Pressly used Woodson's statistics for 1830 to determine that about 42 percent of these black slaveholders owned just one slave. To Gates, this suggests that many -- though hardly all -- black ""slaveholders"" legally needed to ""own"" a family member such as a wife or child.</p>
<p>As Woodson wrote in his 1924 book <em>Free Negro Owners of Slaves in the United States</em> <em>in 1830</em>, ""In many instances the husband purchased the wife or vice versa. … Slaves of Negroes were in some cases the children of a free father who had purchased his wife. If he did not thereafter emancipate the mother, as so many such husbands failed to do, his own children were born his slaves and were thus reported to the numerators.""</p>
<p>In other cases, Woodson wrote, ""Benevolent Negroes often purchased slaves to make their lot easier by granting them their freedom for a nominal sum, or by permitting them to work it out on liberal terms.""</p>
<div class=""pf_subheadline"">Our ruling</div>
<p>The viral post said that ""at the PEAK of slavery in 1860, only 1.4% of Americans owned slaves. What your history books doesn’t tell you is that 3,000 blacks owned a total of 20,000 slaves the same year.""</p>
<p>In reality, far more than 1.4 percent of families in slaveholding states -- the most reasonable way to measure it -- owned slaves. The number was between 20 and 25 percent, and in some states, the rate was twice as high. As for black-owned slaves, they certainly existed, but they represented a tiny fraction of all slaves in the United States, and many were likely ""owned"" by their spouses or parents due to the prevailing laws in many slaveholding states.</p>
<p>We rate the statement False.</p>

</div>]","Confederate-themed posts are cropping up on social media in the wake of the Unite the Right march in Charlottesville, Va.
The march was sparked by efforts to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and included some marchers carrying Confederate symbols.
One viral post sent to us by a reader said, ""At the PEAK of slavery in 1860, only 1.4% of Americans owned slaves. What your history books doesn’t tell you is that 3,000 blacks owned a total of 20,000 slaves the same year."" The post is signed, ""Proud Southern Deplorable - Southern Rebel"" and goes on to say, ""If you're sick of the race baiting, please LIKE and SHARE.""

 
When we took a closer look, we found that the percentage of slaveholding families was dramatically higher than what the meme said, and that the number of slaves owned by blacks was presented in a misleading way.
'At the PEAK of Slavery in 1860, Only 1.4% of Americans owned slaves.'
The primary source of data about slaves and slaveholding in 1860 is that year’s census.
Census data from 1860 isn’t perfect, said University of North Carolina historian Joseph T. Glatthaar, author of Soldiering in the Army of Northern Virginia: A Statistical Portrait of the Troops Who Served under Robert E. Lee. But it remains ""the best evidence we have.""
In the big picture, the 1860 Census counted a total of 31,443,321 people, of which 3,953,760 were slaves. So slaves accounted for 12.6 percent of the national population.
However, to address the assertion in the post requires more detailed data. Many states had outlawed slavery by 1860, so the national population figure dilutes the measurement by including many Americans whose states did not allow them to own slaves. The national population figure also includes slaves and children, and it doesn’t account either for family groupings or how many slaves a given family owned.
So experts say that a more accurate measure of slaveholding in 1860 America would focus on states that allowed slavery, and would zero in on family or household units, as a way of limiting the statistical noise caused by counting slaves and children.
""The number that really matters is how many American households in the South had slaves,"" said Adam Goodheart, a Washington College historian and author of 1861: The Civil War Awakening. 
Using Census data to research his book, Glatthaar calculated that 4.9 percent of people in the slaveholding states owned slaves, that 19.9 percent of family units in those states owned slaves, and that 24.9 percent of households owned slaves. (Households are a broader category than families.)
!function(e,t,s,i){var n=""InfogramEmbeds"",o=e.getElementsByTagName(""script""),d=o[0],r=/^http:/.test(e.location)?""http:"":""https:"";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=r+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var a=e.createElement(""script"");a.async=1,a.id=s,a.src=i,d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)}}(document,0,""infogram-async"",""//e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");
Each of these figures is significantly higher than the 1.4 percent cited in the social media post.
State-by-state figures show some variation. In Mississippi, 49 percent of families owned slaves, and in South Carolina, 46 percent did. In border states, the percentage was lower -- 3 percent in Delaware and 12 percent in Maryland. The median for slaveholding states was about 27 percent.
Using the same data, it's possible to calculate the statistic of dubious value cited in the viral image -- the percentage of all American families that owned slaves. The answer: 7.4 percent, which about five times greater than what the meme says.

'3,000 blacks owned a total of 20,000 slaves the same year.'
We were unable to find hard data to debunk -- or support -- this figure.
The most solid data we found was published in an article in the Root by Henry Louis Gates Jr., a Harvard University historian. Gates cited research by Carter G. Woodson, an African-American historian who died in 1950. He found that in 1830, a total of ""3,776 free Negroes owned 12,907 slaves.""
With three more decades of population growth, it’s plausible that the number of black-owned slaves could have grown to 20,000 by 1860, historians told us.
""I'd imagine that the (20,000 figure) quoted in the meme is probably not that far off from being true,"" said Junius Rodriguez, a Eureka College historian and author of Slavery in the United States: A Social, Political, and Historical Encyclopedia.
But the 20,000 number is not necessarily as eye-popping as the meme makes it out to be.
For starters, even if the number is accurate, it would still account for just a tiny percentage of all slaves held in the United States in 1860 -- specifically, one half of 1 percent. That runs contrary to the post’s framing.
""That’s a very small number compared to Latin American or Caribbean societies,"" said Stephanie McCurry, a Columbia University historian and author of Confederate Reckoning: Power and Politics in the Civil War South.
In addition, the figure is almost certainly inflated by a legal quirk in most antebellum southern states.
It includes ""many ‘owned’ family members whom they had purchased to become free,"" said Eric Foner, a Columbia University historian and the author of such books as The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery.

Gates, writing in the Root, noted that the late historian Thomas J. Pressly used Woodson's statistics for 1830 to determine that about 42 percent of these black slaveholders owned just one slave. To Gates, this suggests that many -- though hardly all -- black ""slaveholders"" legally needed to ""own"" a family member such as a wife or child.
As Woodson wrote in his 1924 book Free Negro Owners of Slaves in the United States in 1830, ""In many instances the husband purchased the wife or vice versa. … Slaves of Negroes were in some cases the children of a free father who had purchased his wife. If he did not thereafter emancipate the mother, as so many such husbands failed to do, his own children were born his slaves and were thus reported to the numerators.""
In other cases, Woodson wrote, ""Benevolent Negroes often purchased slaves to make their lot easier by granting them their freedom for a nominal sum, or by permitting them to work it out on liberal terms.""

The viral post said that ""at the PEAK of slavery in 1860, only 1.4% of Americans owned slaves. What your history books doesn’t tell you is that 3,000 blacks owned a total of 20,000 slaves the same year.""
In reality, far more than 1.4 percent of families in slaveholding states -- the most reasonable way to measure it -- owned slaves.

As for black-owned slaves, they certainly existed, but they represented a tiny fraction of all slaves in the United States, and many were likely ""owned"" by their spouses or parents due to the prevailing laws in many slaveholding states.
We rate the statement False.
